A ROMAN MATRON TO ΗΕΒ HUSBAND 32].

Once let the nether realm receive the shade,
The adamantine bar turns not again.

Prayer may move heaven, but, the sad river passed, 5
The grave relentless gives not back its dead:

Such sentence spake the funeral trumpet's mast,
As sank in funeral flames thy loved one’s head.

No honors that on Paullus' consort wast,

No pride of ancestry or storied bust, ιο
Could save Cornelia from her cruel fate:

Now one small hand may hold her grandeur’s dust.

Shades of the Dead and sluggish fens that gloom
Around HeH's mul-ky shores my steps to bind‚
Before my hour, but pure in soul‚ I come, 15

Then let the J udge of all the Dead be kind.

Call the dread court: let silence reign in Hell3
Set for an hour the damned from torture free,

And still the Guardian Hound. If aught I tell
But truth‚ fall Hell's worst penalty on me. 20

Is honor to a glorious lineage due?

What my sires were, Afric and Spain proclaim 3
Nor poor the blood I from my mother drew, ι

For well may Libo's match with Scipio’s name.

And when, my virgin vesture laid. aside‚ 25
They placed the matron’s wreath upon my head,
Thine‚ Paullus, I became, till death thy bride:
“ Wedded to one ” shall on my tomb be read.

By glory’s shrine I swear‚ great Scipio's tomb,
Where sculptured. Afric sits a captive maid, 30
