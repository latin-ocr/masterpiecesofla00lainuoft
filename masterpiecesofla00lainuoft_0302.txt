274 HORA ΟΕ

Centurions and the like — were wont to swarm,
With slate and satchel on sinister arm,

And the poor dole of scanty peuce to pay

The starveling teaeher monthly to the day 3

But boldly took me when a boy to Rome,
There to be taught all arts, that grace the home
Of knight and senator.

He afterwards went to Athens to continue his studies, and he
was there at the time of the assassination of Caesar. His
sympathies at this period of his life seem to have been
strongly Republican, for he joined the forces of Brutus and
Cassius, and fought as a military tribune at Philippi. The
seventh ode of the second book has a humorous reference
to his experience as a soldier. When the war was over he
was pardoned, and returned to Rome, where he became
one of that coterie of literary men which was known as the
Maecenas circle, enjoying the patronage of Augustus' prime
minister, and of Augustus himself. Here or at his villa in
the Sabine country, which he owed to the generosity of
Maecenas, he spent his life, perfectly content with a modest
competence and the fame which his writings won him.

His works consist of four books of ngs, the Carmen
saeculare, composed for the <celebration of the Secular
Games under Augustus, a number of Epodes, two books of
Satires, and two books of Epistles. The collection of* oda-.-
shows a great variety of subjecte. Some of them are love
poems written in the mock serious tone which is peculiarly
Horatian: for example, the thirteenth of the first book, ad-
dressed to Lydia, the sixteenth, to Tyndaris, the nineteenth‚
to Glycera, the twenty-third, to Chloe, the eighth of the
second book, to Barine, the tenth of the third, to Lyce. The
length of the list will serve to show that our poet’s affee-
tions had a wider range than is altogether consistent with
even a moderate standard of constancy. A much more
serious vein appears in the odes devoted to questions of
politics and mol-als, as the fourteenth of the first book, Ι

To the Ship of State, and the noble series at the beginning
