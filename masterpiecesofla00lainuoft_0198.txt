170 CICERO

for me only, what you must do. If Caesar means to
come to Rome in a peaceable manner, you can stay at
home with safety for the present : but if in his mad·
ness he is going to give up the city to plunder, I sear
Dolabella 1 himself may not be able to protect us suffi-
ciently. Besides, I am alarmed lest we should be cut
off from you, so that when you do wish to leave town
you may be prevented. There is one other thing,
which you are in the best position to observe yourselves
—are other ladies of your rank remaining in Rome ?
If not, it deserves consideration whether you can do so
with propriety. As things stand at present, indeed,
always provided that I am allowed to hold this district,
you will be able to stay with me or on one of our es-
tates with the greatest comfort. There is another
thing I am afraid of -— a want of provisions in the city
before long. On these points pray consult with Pom-
ponius,2 with Camillus, with anybody you think right:
above all don't be frightened. Labienus has made
things better for us. Piso, too, is helpful in quitting
the city and declaring his own son-in-law guilty of
treason. Do you, dear hearts, write to me as often as
possible, and tell me how you are and what‘ is going
on around you. Quintus and his son and Rufus send
their love. Good-bye 1
