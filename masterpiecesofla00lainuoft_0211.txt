military service under M. Minucius Thermus in Asia. On
his return to Rome in 78, he came foi-ward with an accusa-
tion of extortion against Cn. Dolabella, who had been pro-
consul of Macedonia. Although nnsuccessful in this and.
in a similar attempt directed against Gaius Antonius, for-
merly proconsul in Greece, his speeches won high pmise,
and he was regarded as one of the best orators of the time.
He subsequently pursued his rhetorical studies under Molon
at Rhodes. After holding office as quaestor, aedile, and
praetor, he went in 61 to Further Spain as propraetor.
The year-'60 saw the formation of the first triumvirate‚
which made him, together with Pompey and Crassus, su-
preme in the state. Consul in 59, he was in the following
year appointed to the proconsulship of Gaul, where he spent
the greater part of nine years, actively engaged in military
and administrative work. In the mean time a rupture be·
tween him and Pompey had taken place. In the Civil WVar
which followed, the victories at Pharsalus (48), Thapsus
(46), and Munda (45) made him absolute master of the
Roman world. His triumph, however, was short-lived; he
was assassinated on the 15tl1 of March, 44.

The commentaries on the Gallio War are a record of his
career in Gaul during the years 58-52‚ and were in all proba·
bility written in 51. There are seven books, each giving an
account of the events of a single year. The last two years
of his command are treated by his lieutenant Hirtius in the
eighth book. The gap between the Gallie War and the Civil
War, that is, the years 51—49, is filled by the narratives
of others of his lieutenants dealing with the Alexandrian,
the African, and the Spanish wars. His commentaries
on the civil War consist of three books, the first two tak-
ing up the events of 49, the third those of 48. His aim
in writing the account of the Gallic War seems to have
been to impress the Roman people with the greatness of his
services in extending the bounds of their empire. In his
work on the Civil War he doubtless desired to show that
he had done everything in his power to avert the War.
