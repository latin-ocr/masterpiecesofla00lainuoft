AENEAS’ DESCE'NT INTO HADES 229

“ Gulde us, if ever a way be, and eleaving swiftly the
Wing {ii-liii} grove where in shadow a golden branch

overlies 200
One all-favored spot. Nor do thou in an hour that
is dark,
Mother‚ desert thy son!’' So saying, he pauses to
mark

What be the omens, and whither the birds go. They
in their flight,

Soaring‚ and lighting to seed, keep still in the Teu-
erians’ sight.

When they have come to the valley of baleful Aver-
nus, the pair, 205

Shooting alost, float up through a bright and radiant
au· ;

Both on a tree they have chosen at length their pin-
ions fold

Through whose branches of green is a wavering
glimmer of gold.

As in the winter forest a mistletoe often ye see 209

Bearing a foliage young, no growth of its own oak-tree‚

Ciroling the rounded boles with a leafage of yellow-
ing bloom 3

Such was the branching gold, as it shone through the
holm-oak's gloom,

So in the light wind rustled the foil. Aeneas with bold

Ardor assails it, breaks from the tree the reluctant
gold 3 214

Then to the Sibyl’s palace in triumph carries it home.

Weeping for dead Misenus the Trojan host 011 the
shore
Now to his thankless ashes the funeral offerings bore.
