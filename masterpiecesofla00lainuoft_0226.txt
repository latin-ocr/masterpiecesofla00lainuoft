VIRGIL

 

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

WHILE in trQQEOEfiC inspiration virgil does not rank
with-*Lucretius or Catullus, yet in his larger conception
of the poet’s function, in his more artistic handling of his

,κ

rior to them. He is a product of the Augustan age, with
its more settled political and social atmosphere, its wider
culture, and its higher ideals of literary art. We miss, it
is true, the individual note that marks the work of some
of the earlier poets, but in its place is something of fuller
volume, an essentially national tone, emanating from one
who was possessed with the idea of his country's greatness.
In his Georqc'cs he sings the praise of Italian agriculture;
his ᾼβῃςεζά is a glorification of the Roman race.

He was born in Mantua in 70 Β. c. His parents were
plebeians, but sufficiently prosperons to give their son a good
education. He received his first training at Cremona, went
afterwards to Naples‚ and finally to Rome. How long he
remained at the capital on this occasion is not certain, but
we know from the Ecloques that he was in his native place
during the troubles caused by the confiscation of lands in
northern Italy for the benefit of the veterans of Octavian 1
after the battle of Philippi in 42 Β. c. The soldiers, not
satisfied with the lands which had been assigned to them
around Cremona, proceeded to seize those near Mantua;
and it was only through the protection afforded him by
Asinius Pollio, the legate in the district, and afterwards

¹ Afterwards the Emperor Augustus.
