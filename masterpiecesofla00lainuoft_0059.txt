PHORMIO 31

Antipho. But, if I remember rightly, a day was
fixed long ago, by which you were to pay him.

Phaedria. So it was.

Dorio. Do Ι deny it ἶ)

Antipho. Has that day passed?

Dorio. No, but this one has come before it.

Antipho. Are n’t you ashamed of your treach-
ery ?

Dorio. Not a bit, if Ι make anything out of it.

Geta. Dirtl ‘

Phaedria. Dorio, is this the way to aet?

Dorio. It 's my way 3 take it or leave it.

Antipho. And you deceive him like this?

Dorio. But, Antipho, it 's he who 's deoeiving me.
He knew what I was; Ι thought he was something
different. He ’s taken me in; Ι 've been to him just
what I always was. But however that may be, Ι 'll
do this mueh for you. The soldier said that he 'd
give me the money early to-morrow morning. If you
bring it to me before he does, Phaedria, Ι ’ll aot on

my old rule, “ First come, first served.” That ’s all.
[Exit.

SCENE 6.

Phaedria. What am Ι to do? Miserable man
that Ι am, how ean Ι find the money for him on such
short notice, I who have less than nothing? If we
could have got him to wast, it was promised me in

‚ three days.

Antipho. Geta, ean we let him be so unhappy, him
who helped me so kindly a little while ago, as you
told me‘? Now that he needs it, let ’s try to repay our
debt of gratitude to him.

Geta. That 's what we ought to do, I know.
