PHORMIO 57

we shall be able to take vengeance on this scoundrel
in our own way.

Phormio (aeide). Hellol unless I keep a sharp
lookout I'll be in a fix3 they ’re coming at me with
the spirit of gladiators.

Chremes (to DEMIPHO). But Ι 'm afraid. she '11
never forgive me.

Demipho (to CHREMES). Cheer up, I’ll restore
you to favor with her, Chremes. There ’s the fact
that the girl's mother has passed away to fall back
⁴ upon.

Phormio. So this is how you treat me? A elever
enough plan of attackl Eub, Demipho, you've done
your brother no good in goading me on. (To
CHREMES.) What! after amusing yourself as you
pleased in foreign parts, and showing so little respect
to your wife here, a lady of birth 1:00, as to insult
her in this outrageous way, you mean to go whining
to her for forgiveness, do you? By telling her the
whole story, I’ll so kindle her wrath that you’ll
never quench the flames, even though you dissolved
in tears.

Demipho. To think of any man being so impu-
dent! The scoundrel ought to be transported ab the
public expense to some desert land.

Chremes. He 's got me in so tight a place that I
really don’t know what: to do with him.

Demipho. I know 3 let ’s go to law,

Phormio. To law, certainly. In this court, if you
please. (Goes towards CHREMES’ house.)

Chremes. After him! Hold him back, while I call
the slaves out! (DEMIPHO takes hold of Pflomuo.)

Demipho. But I ean’t hold him alone3 come and
help me. (CHREMES takes hold of Pnomno.)
