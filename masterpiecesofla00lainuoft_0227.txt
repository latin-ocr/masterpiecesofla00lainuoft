VIRGIL 199

by the intervention of Octavian himself, that the poet was
secured in the possession of his farm. From this time on
he enjoyed the pati-onage of Maecenas and Octavian, liv-
ing for the most part either at Naples or at Rome. About
37 Β. 0., possibly at the suggestion of Maecenas, he be-
gan the composition of the Georyics, and the next seven
years were spent upon this work. The writing of the
Aeneid followed, and he had devoted eleven years to it
when he died in 19 Β. c. while returning from a journey
to Athens.

Not to mention some minor poems attributed to him,
Virgil’s works consist of the Ecloqzces, ten in number, the
Gom-yios, in four books, and the Aeneid, in twelve. The
Eeloques are either genuine pastoral poems following
more or less strictly the form used by his model Theocri-
tus, or pastoral allegories in which, while the speakers are
ostensibly shepherds and the pastoral background is pre-
served, prominent personages of the time are really repre-
sented and topics discussed which have no connection what-
ever with any phase of shepherd life. To the first class
the second, third, fifth, seventh‚ and eighth belong, some of
them (the third, seventh, and eighth) showing the amoe-
baean structure that is characteristic of bucolic poetry. In
the second class are the first, the sixth, the ninth, and the
tenth. The fourth is altogether outside the bucolic sphere.

The content of the Georqics is aptly summed up in the
opening lines ε - ·

What pains for cattle keeping, or what proof

Of patient trial serves for thrifty bees, —
Such are my themes.

Among the many sources used by the poet in the composi-
tion of the work we find writers as far removed from one
another as Homer and Hyginus. A large element, however,
