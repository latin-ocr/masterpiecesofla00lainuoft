THE DEATH OF HANNIBAL¹
(XXXIX, 51.)

Trrus QmNTms FLAMININUS came as ambassador

the Romans by entertaining Hannibal after the flight
of Antiochus, and by making war on Eumenes. Soon
after his arrival, among other discourse, he remon-

after the conclusion of peace with the Romans. Then, accused by
his political enemies of planning to join forces with Antiochus, king of
Syria, in another attack upon Rome, ho was coxnpelled, on pressure

from the Romans, to fleo from Carthago. He went first to Tyro, then
to Ephesus, and finally to the court of Prusias, king of Bithynia.
