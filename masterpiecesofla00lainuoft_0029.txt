TER-ENCE

BIOGRAPHIC AL SKETCH

A NATIVE of Carthage‚ born about 190 Β. C„ Terence
carne at an early age to Rome, where from¹ the lowly posi-
tion of a slave in one of the patrician households he rose to
distinction as one of the great representatives of Roman
comedy. He belonged to the litei-ary clique known as the
Scipionic circle, of which the younger Scipio Africanus was
the most conspicuous figure, and which included among oth-
ers Laelius, whom Cicero afterwards made the principal
interlocutor in his dialogue On Friendslcip, Polybius the
historian, Panaetius the Stoic philosopher, Philus, and Me·
tellus, —all of them men of broad culture and deeply im-
bued with a love of Greek literature.

His literary activity was confined to the production of
palliatae, comedies the soenes of which were laid in Goeece,
and which obtained their name from the fact that the person-
ages represented wore the Greek pallium. They were not
original compositions, but were based on plays of Menan-
der (342-292 Β. 0.), and other dramatists of the so-called
New Attio Cmnedy, who, differing essentially in their airus
from the playwrights of the Old Attio Comedy‚ avoided
politics‚ and devoted themselves to the portrayal of social
life. Their comedies were comedies of manners. In a
majority of the plays the central interest is a love intrigue
of more or less doubtful morality. The same types of char-
acter recur again and again : the tearful lover, the damsel
in distress‚ the unscrupulous parasite‚¹ the intriguing slave,

¹ The hanger-on, who in return for his support, assisted his patron in
questionable transactione.
