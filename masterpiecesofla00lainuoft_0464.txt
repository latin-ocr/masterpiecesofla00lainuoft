436 JUVENAL

To read the stars ; I neither can, nor will, το
Presage a father’s death3 Ι never pried

In toads for poison, nor —- in aught beside.

Others may aid the adulterer's vile design,

And bear the insidious gift and melting line,
Seduction’s agents! I such deeds detest3 75
And, honest, let no thies partake my breast.

For this without a friend, the world I quit,

A palsied limb, for every use unfit.

Who now is loved, but he whose conscious breast
Swells with dark deeds, still, still to be supprest‘? so
He payS, he owes, thee nothing (strictly just),

Who gives an honest secret to thy trust3

But, a dishonest 1 — there, he feels thy power,

And buys thy friendship high from hour to hour.
But let not all the wealth which Tagus pours 85
In Ocean’s lap, not all his glittering stores,

Be deemed a bribe sufficient to requite

The loss of peace by day, of sleep by night: ——

Oh take not, take not what thy soul rejects,

Nor sell the saith which he who buys suspects l 90
The nation, by the great admit-ed, carest,

And hated, shunned by me above the rest,

No longer now restrained by wounded pride,

I haste to show (nor thou my warmth deride)

I cannot rule my spleen, and calmly see 95
A G‘recian capital in Italy Ῐ

Grecian‘? Ο no ἕ with this vast sewer compared,
The dregs of Greece are scarcely worth regard ε
Long since, the stream that wauton Syria laves

Has disembogued its filth in Tiber’s waves, 10⁰
Its language, arts ς o'erwhelmed us with the scum
Of Antioch's streets, its minstrel, harp, and drum.
Hie to the Circus 1 ye who pant to prove
