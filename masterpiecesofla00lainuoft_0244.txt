216 VIRGIL

F ierce feud anses, and at once from far

You may discern what passion sways the 11101),

And how their hearts are throbbing for the strife3 5
Hark l the hoarse brazen note that warriors know
Chides on the loiterers, and the ear may catch

A sound that mocks the war-trump's broken blasts3
Then in hot haste they muster, then flash wings,
Sharpen their pointed beaks and knit their thews, ιο
And round the king, even to his royal tent,

Throng raflying, and with shouts defy the foe.

So when a dry spring and clear space is given,

Forth from the gates they burst, they clash on high;
A din arises 3 they are heaped and rolled 15
Into one mighty mass, and headlong fall,

Not denselier hail through heaven, nor pelting so
Rains from the shaken oak its acorn-shower.
Conspicuous by their wings, the chiefs themselves
Press through the heart of battle‚ and display 20
A giant's spirit in each pigmy frame,

Steadfast no inch to yield till these 01· those

The victor’s ponderous arm has turned. to ssight.
