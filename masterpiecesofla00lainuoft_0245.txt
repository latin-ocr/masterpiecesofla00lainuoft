AENEAS' DESCENT INTO HADES 217

Seaward the bows are pointed, an anchor's hook to
the land

Fastens the ships, and the sterns in a long line bordei·
the strand.

Troy's young warriors leap with exultant hearts from

the bark 5

Forth upon Italy's soil. Some look for the fiery
spark

Hid in the secret veins of the flint3 some seour the
profound

Forest, and wild beasts’ cover, and show where waters
abound.

While the devout Aeneas a temple seeks 011 the
height,

Phoebus's mountain throne, and a cavern vast as the
night, 10

Where in mysterious darkness the terrible Sibyl 1 lies,

Maiden upon whose spirit the Delian seer2 of the

Breathesg1 li3i8s immortal thought, and the knowledge of
doom untold.

Soon they arrive at Diana's grove and. her palaoe of
gold.

Flying, as legends tell, from the thraldom of Minos3
the king, 15

Daedalus‚4 trusting the heavens, set forth on adven·
turous wing3

Sailed for the iae-bound north by a way unimagined
and strange ;

Airily poising at last upon this Chalcidian range,

1 The Cumaean Sibyl. 2 Apollo.
³ King of Crete.
4 The famous artisan of Attio and Cretan mythology.
