TRAJAN TO PLINY
(97.)

YOU have adopted the proper course, my dear Pliny,
in examining into the cases of those who have been
denounced to you as Christians, for no hard and fast
rule can be laid down to meet a question of such wide
extent. The Christians are not to be hunted out3 if
they are brought before you and the offense is proved,
they are to be punished, but with this reservation, —
that if any one denies that he is a Christian and
makes it clear that he is not, by offering prayers to
our deities, then he is to be pardoned because of his
recantation‚ however suspicious his past conduct may
have been. But pamphlets published anonymously
must not carry any weight whatever, no matter what
the charge may be, for they are not only a precedent

of the very worst type, but they are not in consonance ’

with the spirit of our age.
