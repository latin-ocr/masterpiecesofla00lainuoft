316 PROPERTIUS

And there th' cnsanguined wavc of Sicily,1
And sceptred Alexandria's 2 captive shore, 45
And sad Philippi,3 red with Roman gore:
Then, while the vaulted skies loud Ios ‘¹ rend,
In golden chains should loaded monarchs bend,
And hoary Nile with pensive aspect seem
To mourn the glories of his sevenfold stream, 50
While prOWS,⁵ that late in fierce encounter met,
Move through the Sacred XVay and vainly threat,
Thee too the Muse should consecrate to fame,
And with her garlands weave thy ever-faithful name.
But nor Callimachus' 6 enervate strain 55
May tell of Jove, and Phlegra's ⁷ blasted plain3
Nor I with unaccustom’d vigor trace
Back to its source divine the Julian race.
Sailors to tell of winds and seas delight,
· The shepherd of his flocks, the soldier of the fight, 60
A milder warfare I in verse display;
Each in his proper art should waste the day:
Nor thou my gentle calling disapprove,
To die is glorious in the bonds of love.
Happy the youth, and not unknown to fame, 65
WVhose heart has never felt a second flame.
Oh, might that envied happiness be mine!
