PHAETHON 335

And now the ehild¹ of Clymene the steep

Aseending, passed the threshold of his Sire

Yet unassured, and toward the Godhead bent 25

His steps, yet far off stood, nor nearer bore

The dazzling radianee. Clad in flowing robe

Of purple, on a throne of state, that shone

Crusted with beryl, Phoebus sate. To right

And left were ranged the Days, and Months, and
Years, 30

And Ages, and the Hours, with each its space

Allotted equal. Spring, with flowery crown

Round his young brows, -— and Summer, lightly elad,

With wreath of odorous spices‚ —Autumn, stained

With juiee of trodden wine-press, — and the head 35

Of Winter, white with frost and age, -- were there.

Himself sits midmost : — nor eseapes his eye

All-seeing long the youth, with wonder-ing awe

Such marvels viewing: —and “ that brings thee
here,

My offspring, ——- for I recognize thee such, — 40
What wouldst thou of me ? '' asks the God. To
whom

The youth — ‘⁴ O common light of all the world,
Phoebus, my Sire, if by such name I dare

Address thee, nor hath Clymene her shame

With falsehood sought to veil‚ — give me, I pray, 45
Some pledge whereby henoeforth I may be known
Thy son indeed, and all this doubt be cleared! ’'

He said - and straight the Godhead laid aside

The dazzling glories of his brow, and bade

Approach, and folded in his arms his child, 50
And — “ Ο well worthy to be owned my Son‚’'
