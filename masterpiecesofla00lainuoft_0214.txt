186 CA ESA R

narrOW‚ many of the thronging fugitives were cut
down 3 while others threw themselves off their horses
and tried to scramblc over the wall. The legions,
by Caesar’s order, moved forward a little. The Gauls
inside the wall were smitten with panio ε “ To arms! ”
they cried‚ “To arms! '⁹ Many 01 them fled helter-
skelter up the hillside ; and Vercingetorix was obliged
to shut the gates 01 1116 town, 101· fear the camp should
be left unprotected.

He saw with dismay that the toils were closing
around him. He had never expected that Caesar,
who had failed so ignominiously at Gergovia, would
be strong enough to attempt a systematic blockade.
But there were now ten legions instead 01 six3 and
wherever he looked, over the plain or down in the
valleys, there were soldiers at work with axe or spade.
There was nothing for it but to appeal to the whole
Gallie people to extricate him from the trap in which
he was caught. The ring 01 redoubts was not yet
complete: the Romans were far too few to blockade
the whole circuit of the mountains ς and the cavalry
might perhaps steal out in the dark without attract-
ing notice. He charged them to go, each to his own
country, and bring back with them every man who
could wield a sword. He reminded them 01 all that
he had done for the good cause, and adjured them
not to abandon him to the vengeance 01 1116 Romans.
Everything depended on their using all speed : if
they left him to perish, the whole garrison would per-
ish with him. By reducing the rations‚ he reckoned
that he might make the provisions last a little over a
month. Silently up each river valley sped the shad-
owy cavaleade‚ until it was lost to view.

Caesar learned the whole story from some deserters.
