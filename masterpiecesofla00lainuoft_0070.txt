Chremes. Now Ι wonder where I 'm to find those
women.
SCENE 6.

Enter SoanONA from DEMIPHo’s house.

Sophrona. What am I to do? wretched woman
that I am, whom ean Ι find to befriend me? VVhom
ean I ask for advice ἶ) Where turn for help? I ’m
afraid that, as a result of my eounsel, my mistress
may be shamefully treated, for Ι hear that the young
man’s father is furious at what he ’s done.

Chremes (aside). Now, who in the world is this
old woman coming out of my brother’s house in such
a fluster ἶ)

Sophrona. It was want that drove me to it. Ι knew
that this marriage was invalid‚ but Ι wanted her to
be safe in the meantime.

Chremes (aside). By Heaven, unless my mind de-
ceives me or my eyesight 's failing, this is my daugh-
ter’s nurse.

Sophrona. And the man who is her father —

Chremes (asida). What am I to do?

Sophrona. Can't as yet be discovered.

Chremes (aside). Shall Ι go up to her, or wait till
I understand better what she 's saying?

Sophrona. But if Ι could find him now Ι should
have nothing to sear.

Chremes (asz'de). It 's she herself 3 I ‘ll speak to
her.

Sophrona. Who 's talking here ?

Clu-emes. Sophrona 1

Sophrona. And mentioning my name?
