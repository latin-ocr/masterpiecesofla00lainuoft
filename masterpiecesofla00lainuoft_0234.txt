206 VIRGIL

So to the passionless heart of this icc-cold lover of

mme 70
I may reach with my magic ; it is but a chant we
require.

Homeward bring from the city, my chants, bring
Daphnis again.

Chants from her heavenLy station can draw down even
the moon 1

Circe once with a chant transformed Ulysses’ train.

Cold snakes split in the meadows asunder with chant
and with tune i '15

Homeward bring from the city, my chants, bring
Daphnis again.

These three threads‚ each tinted a separate color, Ι
twine

Round thee first in a circle; and thrice these altars
around

Carry the image —- a number uneven is dear to the
shrine 3 —

In three knots, Amaryllis, ¹ let each of the colours be
wound. so

Wind thern, prithee, and cry, “ Ι am weaving Venus’s
chain.''

Homeward bring from the city, my chants, bring
Daphnis again.

As in a fire that is one and the same, grows harder
the clay,

Softer the waX, may Daphnis be wrought by passion
to-day.

¹ She addi-essen herself.
