150 CICERO

must put far from your minds3 not to the execrable
Oppianicus, a convictcd criminal now 111 1115 grave.
But if at this trial the stroke of some disaster lay my
guiltless client low, then will he verily in his wretched-
ness —if indeed he continue to live, which it will be
hard for him to do—often bitterly lament that the
poison of F abricus was ever detected. For had it not
been exposed at the time it would have been to this
most miserable man, not poison, but the antidote of
his many sorrows3 aye, and his mother might per·
chance have followed in his funeral procession‚ counter·
feiting grief for the death of her 5011. But as it is
what good will have been done, save that it will seem
as if his life were preserved only for affliction out of
the midst of deathful snares — only that in death 115
might be robbed of the sepulchre of his fathers? Lon g
enough has he been in trouble, gentlemen 3 years
enough has he suffered from prejudice. None save
her who gave him birth was ever so bitter against him
but that e may believe his vengeance is now fully
satisfied. Do you who are just towards all men, who
tenderly sustain all those that are cruelly assailed,
preserve A. Cluentius. Restore him to his townsmen
unharmed3 give him back to the friends, the neigh-
bors, the guest-friends of whose zeal for him you are
witnesses ; lay him under an eternal obligation to your-
selves and your children. To you, gentlemen, this ap-
pertains, to your dignity, your clemency ς with justice
do we require you to deliver 31 1351 from his distresses
a most worthy and altogether guiltless man, and 0115
who to very many people is most beloved and dear.
Thus will you give all men to know that, while preju-
dice may find a place in public meethng truth reigns

supreme in courts of laws'ff
