ROME 447

Pray, then, and count your humble prayer well sped,
If pots be only emptied on your head. 395
The drunken bully, ere his man be slain,
F rets through the night, and courts repose in vain 3
And while the thirst of blood his bosom 11111115,
From side to side in restless anguish turns,
Like Peleus’ 5011,1 when, quelled by Hector’s hand, 400
His loved Patroclus pressed the Phrygian strand.
There are who murder as an opiate take,
And only when no brawls await them wake 3
Yet even these heroes, flushed with youth and wine,
All contest with the purple robe decline3 405
Securely give the lengthened train to pass,
The sun-bright flambeaux and the lamps of brass.
Me, whom the moon, or candle's paler gleam,
Whose wick I husband to the last extreme,
Guides through the g100m‚2 he braves, devoid of sear:
The prelude to our doughty quarrel hear, 411
If that be deemed 6 quarrel, where, heaven knows,
He only gives, and I receive, the blows 1
Across my path he strides, and bids me stand!
I bow, obsequious to the dread command3 415
What else 1611161115, where madness‚ rage, combine
With youth and strength superior far to mine?
‘⁶ VVhence come you, rogue ? ’' he eries. “ Whose
beans to-night
Have stuffed you thus? What cobbler clubbed his mite
For leeks and sheep's-head porridge? Dumbl quite
dumbl 420
Speak, or be kicked. Yet, once again! your home?
Where shall I find you‘? At what beggar’s stand
(Temple or bridge) whimp’ring with outstretched

hand ? ''
