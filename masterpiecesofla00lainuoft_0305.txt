WJNTER 277

WIN TER
(odes, 1.‚ 9.)

SEE, Thaliarch‚ see, across the plain
Soracte ¹ white with snow l
Scarce may the laboring woods sustain
Their load, and locked in icy chain
The streams have ceased to flow. 5

Logs on the fire, your biggest‚ fling,
To thaw the pinching cold‚
And from the time to take its sting
A pipkin forth of Sabine bring,
Four mellowing summers old. ιο

All else unto the Gods leave we;
When they have stilled the roar
Of winds that with the yeasty sea
Confliet and brawl, the cypress—tree,
The old ash shake no more. 15

What with to·morrow comes forbear
To ask, and. count as gain

Each day fate grants, ere time and care

Have chilled thy blood, and thinned thy hair,
Love's sweets do not disdain 3 20

Nor, boy, disdain the dance! For, mark,
Now is thy time to take
J oy in the play, the crowded park,
And those low whispers in the dark,
Which trysting lovers make. 25

¹ Mt. Soracte, about twenty-five miles north of Rome.
