the historical records which the priests kept3 it was
the latter that animated the Fescennine verses, and
formed the dominating element in the old satura. In
the literature that followed, in the great majority of
the works that were produced from the middle of the

its advantages or disadvantages as a preliminary to
an orator's equipment. It is true that Roman orators
were trained in Greek rhetorical methods, made a
careful study of the great Greek orators, and were
familiar with all the details of the battle between the
Atticists and the Asiatics3 but this, far from being
slavish imitation, was only part and parcel of their
desire for efficiency, their earnestness in everything
