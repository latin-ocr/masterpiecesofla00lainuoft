AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 249

I, that night, overburdened with troubles, buried in

Lay in Stlffizwal ohamber, delicious slumber and (leeg

Folding mine eyelids, like the unbroken rest of the

She, mgfflgiffle' my glorious spouse, from the palaee

Every 3223? and drawn from the pillow the fal-
ohion I bore,

Then Menelaus ¹ summons, and straightway loosens

the door,

Hoping in sooth that her lover with this great boon
might be won, 530

Deeming the fame of her guilt in the past might so
be undone.

Why on the memory linger? The foe streamed in
at the gate

Led by Ulysses‚ the plotter. May judgment‚ Immor-
tals‚ wait

Yet on the Greeks, if of vengeance a reverent heart
may be fain!
Tell me in turn what sorrow has brought thee alive

and unslain 535
Hither‘?’' he ories3 ‘⁶ art come as a mariner lost on
the main,

Or by the counsel of Heaven ? What fortune drives
thee in quest,
Hither‚ of sunless places and sad, the abodes of un-

rest‘? ’'

Morn already with roseata steeds‚ while talk they
emhange,

Now in her journey has traversed the half of the
heavenly range, 54ss
