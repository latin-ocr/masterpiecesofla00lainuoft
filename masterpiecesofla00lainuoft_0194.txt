166 CICERO

TO C. TREBATIUS TESTA, IN GAUL
(Fam. VII„ 16.)

ΒΟΜΕ, 13. c. 54.

IN the “ Trojan Horse,'' 1 just at the end, you re-
member the words, “Too late they learn wisdom.'‘
You, however, old man, were wise in time. Those first
snappy2 letters of yours were foolish enough, and
then . . . 1 1 don’t at all blame you for not being
over-curious in regard to Britain.3 For the present,
however, you seem to be in winter quarters somewhat
short of warm clothing, and therefore not caring to
stir out: —

“ Not here and there, but everywhere,

Be wise and ware :
No sharper steel can warrior bear.’'

If I had been by way of dining out, I would not have
failed your friend Cn. Octavius ; to whom, however, Ι
did remark upon his repeated invitations, “ Pray, who
are you‘? ’³ But, by Hercules, joking apart, he is a
pretty fellow: I could have wished you had taken him
with you ἔ Let me know for certain what you are do-
ing and whether you intend coming to Italy at all this
winter. Balbus has assured me that you will be rich.
Whether he speaks after the simple Roman fashion,
meaning that you will be well supplied with money, or
according to the Stoic dictum, that “ all are rich who

can enjoy the sky and the earth,'’ I shall know here-

1 A play by one of the earlier Roman dramatists‚ either Livius or
Naevius.

9 The first letters written by Trebatius after going to Gaul seem to
have been full of complaints.

³ Trebatius did not cross the Channel.
