Sevenfold Nile and his mouths, are fluttered and

veyed,

Though he pursued deer brazen of limb, tamed Ery-
manth’s 3 glade‚ 810

Lerna 4 with arrows scared‚ or the Vineg0d‚⁵ when from
the war

mg ear,

Driving his team of tigers from Nysa’s ὅ summits afar.

Bearing the sacred vessels? I know yon tresses, I know

to sustain

Rome yet young3 from the lordship of Cures’8 little
