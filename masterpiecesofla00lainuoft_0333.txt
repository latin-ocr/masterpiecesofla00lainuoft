THE POET’S JDEAL 305

’ Then come, ye powers, nor scorn my frugal board,

Nor yet the gifts clean earthen bowls convey 3
With these the first of men the gods adored,
And form’d their simple shape of ductile clay.

My little flock, ye wolves, ye robbers, spare, 45
Too mean a plunder to deserve your toil 3

For wealthier herds the nightly theft prepare 3
There seek a nobler prey, and richer spoil.

For treasured wealth, nor stores of golden wheat,
The hoard of frugal sires, I vainly call ; 50
A little farm be mine, a cottage neat,
And wonted conch where balmy sleep may fall.

What joy to hear the tempest howl in vain,
And clasp a fearful mistress to my breast3

Or lull’d to slumber by the beating rain, 55
Secure and happy sink at last to rest.

These joys be mine 1 — O grant me only these,
And give to others bags of shining gold,

Whose steely heart can brave the boist'rous seas,
The storm wide-wasting, or the stiff'ning cold. 60

Content with little, I would rather stay

Than spend long months amid the wat’ry waste3
In cooling shades elude the scorching ray,

Beside some fountain's gliding waters placed.

Oh perish rather all that 's rich and rare, 65
The diamond quarry, and the golden vein,

Than that my absence cost one precious tear,
Or give some gentle maid a moment’s pain.
