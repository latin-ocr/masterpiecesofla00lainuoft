PHORMIO ll

Antipho. But, Phaedria, to me it is you who seem
to be the lueky man, for you still have the power of
doing what you choose : you ean keep your sweetheart
or let her go, whereas I, poor wret0h‚ have got into
such a fix that Ι ean neither get rid of my wife nor
keep her. But what is this? Is n’t this Geta that I
see running this way ἶ) So it is. Dear me l Ι wonder
what news he brings.

SCENE 2.

Enter GETA, runninq.

Geta (to himsegf‘, not wotz'cz‘nq ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ and PHAE-
DRIA). You ’re a lost man, Geta, unless you quiekly
devise some plan of protecti0n3 so many disasters
suddenly threaten, and you are so unprepared. Ι
don't know how to avoid them, or how to get myself
out of this serape. Our bold stroke ean’t be kept
secret any longer.

Antipho (aeide to PHAEDRIA). What is it that he ’s
in such a flurry about?

Geta. Besides, I ’ve only a moment for this busi-
ness. The master is here.

Antipho (aeide). What disaster is this?

Geta. When he hears of it, what means shall Ι
find to turn aside his anger? Suppose Ι speak‘? I
should enrage him. Hold my tongue‘? I should
aggravate him. Try to excuse myself‘? Ι might as
well wash a brick. Oh, poor me! Ι ’m in for it. And
then, too, Ι 'm on tenter-books about Antipho 3 Ι pity
him ; Ι fear him. It 's he who ’s keeping me here now.
But for him I should have taken good care of myself,
and paid the old gentleman out for his ill temper3 Ι
should have got a few things together and bolted
straightway.
