TO ATTICUS IN ROME ¹

(Aa. v11.‚ 20.)

CAPUA, Β. c. 49.

not to fight a battle —for who is there to fight with ?

dence and carelessness of our leaders: on the side of
ssight, my friendship for Pompey, the claims of the
loyalist cause, the disgrace of having anything to do
with a tyrant3 as to whom it is uncertain whether he
will copy Phalaris or Pisistratus.3 Pray unravel these

¹ One of the many letters in which Cicero asks Atticus for advice
and guidanoe. He complains of the apathy of the consuls, comparing
it with Caesar’s energetic movements.

² Caesar.

³ Tyrants of Agrigentum and Athens respectively.
