THE POET’S IDEAL 303

the frigid mythological pedantries that disfigure so large a
part of elegiae literature, they reflect‚ probably faithfully
enough, the character of the man, a conservative of conser-
vatives‚ attached to old rites and customs simply because
they were old, shrinking from the strenuous life of war and
politics, gentle, sensitive‚ and, where women were eonem-ned,
of even more than elegiae susceptffiility, a dreamer of
dreams, eternally weaving vague fantasies of love and of
the peace and quiet of rural seclusion.

THE POET’S IDEAL

(1. 1.)

ΤΗΕ glittering ore let others vainly heap,
O'er fertile vales extend th' enclosing mound3
With dread of neighb’ring foes forsake their
sleep‚
And start aghast at every trumpet’s sound.

Me humbler scenes delight, and calmer days3 5
A tranquil life fair poverty secure3

Then boast, my hearth‚ a small but cheerful
Anssbgffgs grasp who will, let me be poor.

Nor yet be hope a stranger to my door,
But o'er'my roof, bright goddess, still preside l 10
With many a bounteous autumn heap my floor‚
And swell my vats with must, a purple tide.

My tender vines I ’ll plant with early care,
And choicest apples with a skilful hand 3

Nor blush, a rustic, oft to guido the share, ιε»
Or goad the sturdy ox along the land.
