8 TERENCE

Davus. Would n't his father, on his return, have
forgiven him ἶ)

Geta. that! He forgive him for marrying a low-
born, dowerless girl? Never.

Davus. What was the outcome of it ἶ)

Geta. The outcome of it ἶ) There ’s a parasite

named Phormio, an impudent fellow, the gods con-
found him 1

Davus. What did he do‘?

Geta. He gave Antipho this advice: “It 's the
law that orphan girls must marry their next of kin,
and this same law commands their next of kin to
marry them. Now, I'll declare you to be next of
kin, and will bring an action against you. I ’ll pre-
tend to be a friend of the girl’s father. The matter
will come before a jury 3 Ι ’ll invent the whole story
about who her father and mother were, and how she
is related to you3 and well shall I serve my own in-

' terest by so doing. You ’ll make no defence to any

of these charges, and I 'll win the case. Your father
will come home. Ι ’ll have a law-suit on my hands.
But what difference will that make to me? The girl
will be ours.''

Davus. What consummate impudence 1

Geta. He got the young fellow's consent, and it
was done3 we went into court—lost our case—he
married her.

Davus. You don't say so!

Geta. Yes, I do.

Davus. Oh, Geta! what will become of you?

Geta. I'm sure I don't kn0w3 all 1 know is that
I ’ll bear patiently whatever may befall.

Davus. Ι like that 3 that 's the way a man should
aot.
