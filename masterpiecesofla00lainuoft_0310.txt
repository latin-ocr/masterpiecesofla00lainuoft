282 HORA GE

Melpomene,¹ in whom the Muses’ sire ε.
Joined with a liquid voice the mastery of the lyre Σ

And hath the sleep that knows no waking morn
Closed o'er Quintilius, our Quintilius dear?
VVhere shall be found the man of woman born
That in desert might be esteemed his peer, — 10
Sincere as he, and resolutely just,
So high of heart, and all so absolute of trust?

He sinks into his rest, bewept of many,
And but the good and noble weep for him,
But dearer cause thou, virgil, hast than any, 15
With friendship's tears thy friendless eyes to dim!
Alas‚ alas! Not to such woeful end
Didst thou unto the gods thy prayers unoeasing send!

What though thou modulate the tuneful shell
With dester skill than Orpheus of old Thrace, 20
When deftliest he played, and with its spell
Moved all the listening forest from its place?
Yet never, never can thy art avail
To bring life's glowing tide back to the phantom pale,

Whom with his black inexorable wand, 25
Hermes,2 austere and pitiless as fate,
Hath forced to join the dark and spectral band
In their sad journey to the Stygian gate.
’Τ is hard, great heavens‚ how hard l But to endure
Alleviates the pang we may nor crush nor cure! 30

¹ The muse of tragedy.
² It was one of the functions of Hermes to conduct the souls of
the dead to the lower world.
