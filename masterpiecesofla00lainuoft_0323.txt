A BORE 295

Ο cur! thy vain threats why not venture on me,
Who cau give back a bite for a bite?

Like mastiff Molossian 1 or Sparta's dun bound, 5
Kindly friend to the shepherd am I,

But Ι prick up my ears and away through the snows,
If a wild beast of prey ruh before ;

But thou, if thou fillest the woods with thy bark‚
Art struck dumb at the sniff of a bone. ιο

Ah, beware ἔ Ι am rough when I come upon knaves,
Ah, beware of a toss from my horns 1

Ι ’m as sharp as the wit 2 whom Lycambes deceived,
Or the bitter foe 3 Bupalus roused3

Dost thou think, when a cur shows the grin of his

teeth, 15

That I 'll weep, unavenged, like a child?

A BORE
(Satires, 1.‚ 9.)

ALONG the Sacred Road 4 I strolled one day,
Deep in some bagatelle (you know my way),
When up comes one whose name Ι scarcely knew—-
“ The dearest of dear fellows 1 how d‘ ye do? ”
He grasped my hand— ‘⁶ well, thanks : the same to
you.” ⁵
Then, as he still kept walking by my side,
To cut things short, “ You ’ve no commands ‘2 ’⁹ Ι
cried.
1 From the country of the Molossi in the north of Greece.
² The poet Archilochus (about 640 B. c.), whose satirical attacks
drove Lycambes to suicide.
Β Hipponax, a poet of Ephesus (about 540 Β. c.), whose satire had

a similar result in the case of the sculptor Bupalus.
4 It ran through the Forum.
