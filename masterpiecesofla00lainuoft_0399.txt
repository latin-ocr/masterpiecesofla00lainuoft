THE MARCH ACROSS THE ALPS 371

Alps. As to what number of forces Hannibal had
when he arrived in Italy, writers by no means agree.
Those who state them at the highest make them
amount to one hundred thousand foot and twenty
thousand horse3 while those who state them at the
lowest say twenty thousand foot and six of horse.
The authority of Lucius Cincius Alimentus,l who
writes that he was taken prisoner by Hannibal, would
have the greatest weight with me, did he not con-
found the number by adding the Gauls and Ligu-
rians. He says that, including these (who, it is more
probable, however, flocked to him afterwards, and so
some writers assert), there were brought into Italy
eighty thousand foot and ten thousand horse 3 and
that he heard from Hannibal himself, that from the
time of his passing the Rhone he had lost thirty-
six thousand men, together with a vast number of
horses and other beasts of burden, before he left the
country of the Taurinians,2 the next nation to the
Gauls as he went down into Italy. That he came to
this state is agreed by all. I am therefore the more
surprised at its remaining doubtful by what road
he crossed the Alps, and »that the opinion should com- '
monly prevail that he passed over the Pennine Hill, and
that from thence that summit of these mountains got
its name.3 Coelius says that he passed over the hill of
Cremo. Either of these passes would have led him
not in the territory of the Tam-inians, but through
that of the mountaiueers‚ called Salluviam, to the
Libyan Gauls. Nor is it probable that those roads
