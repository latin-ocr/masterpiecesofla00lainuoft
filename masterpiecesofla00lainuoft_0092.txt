64 LUCRETIUS

soul, which is, like everything else, material, consisting of
small round atoms of unusual fineness. It cannot exist
apart from the body. In the fourth book we have a treat—
ment of sense perceptions; in the fifth, of the formation of
the world, the origin of life, and the development of man ;
in the sixth, of such natural phenomena as thunder‚ light-
ning, and earthquakes. The poem concludes with au ac-
count of the plague at Athens.

It was not, however, so much the theory of Epicurus that
attracted Lucretius as its practical application. In his
view of life there were two principal causes of unhappiness ε
belief in the interference of the gods in the affairs of the
world, and fear of death. He welcomed the Epicurean
philosophy, because, as he believed, it proved that both
were groundless. Epicurus did, it is true, believe in the
existence of gods, but the atomio theory excluded them
from all part in the creation and management of the world.
They lived in perfect tranquillity somewhere in the vast
spaces between the worlds, and paid no attention to terres-

should dread them. In the same way, the soul having
been proved to be subject to immediate disintegration on
separating from the body, death should have no more ter-
rors.

The most conspicuous feature of the book is the poet’s
splendid enthusiasm. His theme does not at first sight
seem to be an inspiling one, but the atomio theory came to
him as a “⁶1evelation, and the realization of what it meant for
him and for all who would believe filled him with a sort of-
frenzy. He had what the Greeks called μανία possession,

something stronger than inspiration as ordinarily used, and

 

this calrying him without a sign of w eariness through long
and intricate disquisitions on details of the theory, manifests
itself every now and then with increased intensity in some
ari-aignment of religion so-oalled, or some fine piece of de-
scriptive writing, 01· a glorification of Epicurus. All his
