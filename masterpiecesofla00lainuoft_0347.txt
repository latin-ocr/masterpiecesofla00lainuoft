A CHANGE OF VIEW 319

Give me to send the laughing bowl around,

My sou] in Bacchus' pleasing fetters bound ;

Let on this head unfading flowers reside,

There bloom the vernal rose’s earliest pride3 10

And when, our flames commission’d to destroy,

Age step ’twixt love and me, and intercept the joy ;

When my changed head these looks no more shall
know,

And all its jetty honors turn to snow3

Then let me rightly tell of nature's ways3 15

To Providence, to Him my thoughts I 'd raise,

Who taught this vast machine its steadfast laws,

That first, etet-nal, universal cause 3

Search to what region yonder star retires,

That monthly waning hides her paly fires, 20

And whence, anew revived, with silver light

Relumes her cresc-ent orb to cheer the dreary night ε

How rising winds the face of ocean sweep,

Where lie th' eterna] fountains of the deep,

And whence the cloudy magazines maintain 25

Their wintry war, or pour th' autumna] rain 3

How flames, perhaps, with dire confusion hurl'd,

Shall sink this beauteous fabric of the world3

What colors paint the vivid arch 1 of J ove3

What wondrous force the solid earth can move, 30

When Pindus’ 2 self approaching ruin dreads,

Shakes all his pines, and bows his hundred heads3

Why does yon orb, so exquisitely bright,

Obscure his radiance in a short-lived night3

Whence the seven Sisters’ 3 congregated fires, 35

And what Bootes’ 4 lazy wagon tires3

How the rude surge its sandy bounds control3
