THE SPEECH FOR CLUENTIUS 147

this hour of danger. Their town has at this time been
committed to the care of the women and children,
and is at present under the protection, not of its or-
dinary defenders‚ but only of the general peace which
prevails in Italy. And yet even they, no less than
these whom you see here in court, are kept day and
night in suspense and disquietude about the issue of
this trial. For in their view it is not on the fortunes
of a single townsman that you are about to give ver-
diet, but on the standing of the whole municipality,
on its credit, and the whole body of its interests.
Gentlemen‚ the defendant is conspicuous for devotion
to the public good of his town, for kindliness to the in-
habitants individually‚ for righteousness and conscien-
tiousness towards all men 3 and he moreover maintains
in his own circle the position of high rank bequeathed
him by his forefathers in such a way as to emulate
their gravity, their force of character, their popularity‚
their generosity. And therefore do they in the name
of the community pronounce his eulogy in language
which not only expresses their deliberate opinion of
his character, but bears witness also to their solicitude
and sorrow3 and while this eulogy is being read Ι
must ask you who have brought it to stand up. From
the tears of those present, gentlemen‚ you may infer
that when they passed this decree every member of
the town council was also in tears. Again as to the
neighbors‚ what enthusiasm‚ what incredible good-
will, what anxiety do they display! They have not
sentin writing the panegyric they decreed, but have
instructed men of the highest reputation‚ well known
to all of us, to be present here in large numbers and
to pronounce his eulogy in person. Illustrious citizens
of Ferentum ¹ are here 111 court, and men of the Mar-

¹ In Apulia.
