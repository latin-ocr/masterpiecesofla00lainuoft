226 VIRGIL

Subterranean gloom and its mysteries only may be

Reaohed by the mortal who gathers the golden growth
of the tree.

This for her tribute chosen the lovely Proserpinal
needs

Aye to be brought her. The one bough broken, an-
other succeeds,

Also of gold, and the spray bears leaf of a metal as

briam, 150

Deep in tloe forest explore, and if once thou find it
aright,

Pluok it 3 the braneh will follow, of its own grace and
design,

Should thy destiny eall thee3 01· else no labor of
thine

Ever will move it, nor ever thy hatehet eonquer its
mio-ht.

Yea, and che eorpse of a friend, although thou know'st
not‚” she saith, 155

“Lies upon shore unburied, and taints thy vessels
with death,

While thou tarriest here at the gate thy future to
know,

Carry him home to his rest, in the grave his body
bestow3

Death's blaok cattle provide for the altar3 give to
the shades

This first lustral oblation, and so on the Stygian

Even offassezissms where never the feet of the livii}
Thou sfigffefvinassy look.’' Then‚ elosing her lips, she
was dumb.
