PHAETHON 341

Which neither drop nor manage them -- nor knows
By name to call aud pacify his steeds. 216
A place there is in Heaven where Scorpio curves

In double bow his arms, and, with spread tail

And claws on either side outstretched, usurps

Space ample for two signs. When him the Boy 220

And Haemus, by that name of after time,

Aeagrius, yet unknown. With doubled blaze
Flames Aetna, - and Parnassus' cloven erest, —-
