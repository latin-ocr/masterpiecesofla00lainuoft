A RURAL FESTIVAL 309

So shall the hind dread penury no more,

But gayly smiling o'er his plenteous store, 25
With liberal hand shall larger billets bring,

Heap the broad hearth, and hail the genial spring.
His numerous bond-slaves all in goodly rows,

With wicker huts your altars shall enelose.

That done, they ’ll eheerly laugh, and danee, and play,
And praise your goodness in their uneouth lay.'' 31

The gods assent! see 1 see! those entrails show
That heaven approves of what is done below!
Now quaff Falernian, let my Chian wine,
Poured from the cask in massy goblets 81111161 35
Drink deep, my friends: 311, all, be madly gay,
’T were irreligion not to reel to-day!
Health to Messala, every peasant toast,
And not 3 letter of his name be lost 1

O come, my friend, whom Gallie triumphs ¹ grace,
Thou noblest splendor of an ancient raee3 41
Thou whom the arts all emulously erown,

Sword of the state, and honor of the gown 3

My theme is gratitude, inspire my lays 1

Oh be my genius 1 while Ι strive to praise 45
The rural deities, the rural plain.

The use of foodful corn they taught the swain.

They taught man first the socia] hut to mise,

And thateh it o’er with turs, or leafy sprays ς

They first to tame the furious bull essay'd, 50
And 011 rude wheels the rolling earriage laid.

Man left his savage ways3 the garden glow'd.

F ruits not their own admiring trees bestow'd,

¹ Messala was given a triumph in 27 Β. c. for his victory over the
Aquitanians in the battle of Atax.
