220 VIRGIL

Cried the illumined maiden: “The God! lo, here is
the God ! ''

Even as she spake, while still on the threshold only
she trod,

Sudden her countenance altered, her cheek grew pale
as in death,

Loose and disordered her fair hair flew, heart panted
for breath, 50

Bosom with madness heaved. More lofty than wo-
man’s her frame,

More than mortal her voice, as the presence of
Deity came

Nearer upon her. “And art thou slow to petition
the shrine,

Troy’s Aeneas a lagg-ard at prayer?—nought else
will incline

This charmed templess' she eries, “its colossal doors
to unclose.’' 55

Then stands silent. The veteran bones of the Teu-
crians ¹ froze,

Chilled with terror, and prayer from the beart of the
monarch arose :

“Phoebus! compassionate ever to Troy 111 the hour

Who agfailnit vllg‘dghty Achilles of old didst prosper
the bow 59

Bent by the Dardan Paris, beneath thine auspices led

Many a sea I'have travelled around great continents

Far as εῧὲζξῆἰαηῖ tribes and the quicksands lining
their plain.

Italy's vanishing regions, behold, thy people attainl

1 The Trojans.
2 On the north coast of Africa.
