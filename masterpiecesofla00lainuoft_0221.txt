THE SIEGE OF ALESIA 193

Roman artillery made great havoc. The losses on
either side were very heavy3 for they were fighting
in the dark, and shields were of little use. Towards
dawn the Gauls retreated, fearing an attack in flank 3
and the besieged, who had lost much valuable time in
attempting to cross the inner trench, went back before
they could strike a blow.

One more chance remained. The leaders of the
relieving army questioned the rustics about the lie of
the ground on the north and the nature of the Roman
defences. Mont Rea, which bounded the plain and
rose above the further bank of the Oze‚ extended so
far to the north that Caesar had not been able to en-
close it in his line of circumvallation. On the south-
ern slope, close to the stream, stood one of the Roman
camps. It was held by two legions, — perhaps about
eight thousand men, — under Reginus and Caninius.
In order to avoid observation, it would be necessary
to approach the camp by a wide detour. The Gauls
sent scouts to reconnoitre. It appeared that Mont
Rea was connected by a ridge with a further group of
heights. Just after dark sixty thousand picked men,
under the command of Vercassivellaunus, left the
Gallio camp, and, passing right round the sweep of
the northern hills, halted at daybreak for a rest in a
hollow north-east of Mont Rea. About noon‚ just as
they were moving down on the camp, the cavalry, by
a preconcerted arrangement, streamed over the plain
towards the Roman lines: the rest of the infantry
showed themselves in front of their encampment3 and
Vercingetorix, observing these movements from the
citadel, descended the hill and moved towards the
plain.

This time there was no delay. The inner trench
