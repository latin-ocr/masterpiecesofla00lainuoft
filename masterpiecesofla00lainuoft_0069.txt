PHORMIO 41

Semne 5.

Enter Dssmn‘no and Can1ESf1-om the latter’s house.

Demipho. Never you mind, Ι say3 I 'll take care
that he does n’t cheat us. I ’ll never be fool enough
to let this money out of my hands without having
witnesses present3 I ’11 tell them to whom Ι give it,
and for what.

Geta (aside). How careful he is when care is n't
needed!

Chremes. That’s how you ought to do it3 and
make haste, while he’s of the same mind, for if that
other girl becomes more urgent, he may throw us
over.

Geta. You 've hit it exactly.

Demipho (to GETA). Then take me to him.

Geta. I 'm all ready.

Chremes. When you ’ve done this, come over and
see my wife, and she 'll call on the girl before she
goes away. She 'll tell her, by way of preventing her
being angry, that we 're going to marry her to
Phormi03 that he ’s much better suited to her, inso-
much as he 's more closely connected with her; that
we 've not failed in our duty, and have given him as
much dowry as 116 wanted.

Demipho. What the deuce have you to do with
that?

Chremes. A great deal, Demipho. It ’s not suffi-
cient to do your duty3 you must win the world's ap-
proval as well. Ι want: her to act of her own free
will, so that she won't say that she was turned out.

Demipho. Ι can do all this myself.

Chremes. Yes, but it takes 3 woman to manage 3
woman.
