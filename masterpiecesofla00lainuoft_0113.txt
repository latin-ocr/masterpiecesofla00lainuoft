THE DE VEL OPMENT OF MAN 85

of man would then have been wholly cut off, nor could
breeding have continued their generations to this day.

But nature impelled them to utter the various
sounds of the tongue and use struck out the names of
things, much in the same way as the inability to speak
is seen in its turn to drive children to the use of ges-
tures, when it forces them to point with the finger at
the things which are before them. For every one
feels how far he can make use of his peculiar powers.
Ere the horns of a calf are formed and project from
his forehead, he butts with it when angry and pushes
out in his rage. Then whelps of panthers and cubs of
lions fight with claws and feet and teeth at a time
when teeth and claws are hardly yet formed. Again
we see every kind of fowl trust to wings and seek
from pinions a fluttering succor. Therefore to sup-
pose that some one man at that time apportioned
names to things, and that men from him learnt their
first words, is sheer folly. For why should this
particular man be able to denote all things by
words and to utter the various sounds of the tongue,
and yet at the same time others be supposed not to
have been able to do so? Again if others as well as
he had not made use of words among themselves,
whence was implanted in this man the previous con-
ception of its use, and whence was given to him the
original faculty, to know and perceive in mind what
he wanted to do? Again one man could not con-
strain and subdue and force many to choose to learn
the names of things. It is no easy thing in any
way to teach and convince the deas of what is need-
ful to be done3 for they never would suffer nor in
any way endure sounds of voice hitherto unheard to
continue to be dinned fruitlessly into their ears.
