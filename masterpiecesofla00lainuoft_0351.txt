A ROMAN MATRON TO HER HUSBAND 323

In these I live although my life is o’er3 55
Their dear embraces took the sting from death.

Twice did my brother fill the curule chair,1

There sat he when I parted. Daughter‚ thou
Wast born a censor’s child3 be it thy care

Like me, by wedded troth, his rule to show. 60

Now I bequeath our children to thy heart,
Husband‚ though Ι am dust, that care is mine3

Father and mother too henceforth thou art3
Around one neck now all those arms must twiue.

Kiss for thyself and then for her that 's gone3 65
Thy love alone the whole clear burden bears3
If e'er for me thou weepest, weep alone,
And see, to cheat their lips, thou driest thy
tears.

Be it enough by night thy grief to pour,

By night to commune with Cornelia's shade 3 το
If to my likeness in thy secret bower

Thou speakest, speak as though Ι answer made.

Should time bring on another wedcling day,
And set a stepdame in your mothel-'s place,

My children, let your looks no gloom betray 3 75
Kind ways and loving words will win her grace.

Nor speak too much of me 3 the jealous ear
Of the new wife pei-chance offence may take 3
But ah! if my poor ashes are so dcar
That he will live unweddcd for my sake, 80
