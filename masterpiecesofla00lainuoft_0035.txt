of time on our hands, and used to accompany him.
Now there was a barber shop opposite the school
where she took her Iessons, and we generally waited
there till she was ready to go home. One day a young
fellow came in crying. Surprised, we asked him what
was the matter. “N ever before,'' said he, “ has pov-
erty seemed to me so cruel and hard. Ι 've just seen
. a maiden in this neighborhood weeping for her dead
mother, who was buried right opposite. The girl had
no friend, acquaintance, or kinsman — nobody but one
old woman, to help her bury her mother. I felt for
her3 she was such a stunning-looking girl!” Why
make a long story? He moved us all to compassion.
“ Had n’t we better go and see her?'’ said Antipho.
“I think so,'' said some one else3 “show us the
way, please.'' We set out, reached the place, saw her.
She was beautiful, and there was all the more cer-
tainty about it because she had nothing to set off

, her beauty: hair dishevelled —— feet bare — untidy —

weeping—-shabbily dressed. Her beauty had to be
brilliant indeed, not to be eclipsed by all that. Phae-
dria merely said, “She ’s not bad looking,” but my
young master —

Davus. I know· He fell in love with her.

Geta. Yes, but do you know how deeply? Listen
to what happened. Next day he went straight to
the old woman, and implored her to let him have the
girl. She refused, and said that what he asked was
not right3 that the girl was a citizen of Athens, a
good girl of a good family. If he wanted her for his
wife, she would agree to his marrying her legally3 if
not, she would have nothing to do with him. My
young master did n’t know what to do3 he wanted to
marry her, but he feared his father.
