ΤΟ LYDIA
(odes, 1.‚ 25.)

SWAINS in numbers
Break your slumbers,
Sauey Lydia, now but seldom,
Ay, though at your casement nightly‚
Tapping loudly, tapping lightly,
By the dozen once ye held them.

Ever turning,
Night and. morning,
Swung your door upon its hinges ;

Now, from dawn till evening's closing,

Lone and desolate reposing,
Not a soul its rest infringes.

Serenadem,
Sweet invaders,

Scanter grow, and daily scanter,
Singing, ‘⁶ Lydia, art thou sleeping?
Lonely wateh thy love is keeping!

Wake, oh wake, thou dear enchanter! ''

Lorn and faded,
You, as they did,

Woo, and in your turn are slighted3
Worn and torn by passion's fret,
You, the pitiless coque-tte,

Waste by fires yourself have lighted‚

Late relenting‚
Half lamenting —-
