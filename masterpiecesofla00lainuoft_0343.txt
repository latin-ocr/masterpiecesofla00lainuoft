TO MAECENAS

If sinking into sleep she seem to close

Her languid lids, I favor her repose

With lulling notes, and thousand beauties see
That slumber brings to aid my poetry.
When, less averse, and yielding to desires,
She half accepts, and half rejects, my fires,
While to retain the envious lawn she tries,
And struggles to elude my longing eyes,

The fruitful Muse from that auspicious night
Dates the long Iliad of the amorous fight.

In brief, whate'er she do, or say, or look,

’T is ample matter for a lover’s book 3

And many a copious narrative you 'll see

Big with the important nothing’s history.
Yet would the tyrant love permit me raise
My feeble voice, to sound the victor's praise,
To paint the hero’s toil, the ranks of war,
The laurell'd triumph and the sculptured car3
No giant race, no tumult of the skies,

No mountain-structures ¹ in my verse should risa,

Nor tale of Thebes, nor Ilium there should be,
Nor how the Persian trod th' indignant sea 3 2

Not Marius’ Cimbrian 3 wreaths would I relate,

Nor lofty Carthage struggling with her fate.
Here should Augustus great in arms appear,
And thou, Maecenas, be my second care 3

Here Mutina ‘³ from flames and famine free,
