DEDICATION OF HIS PINNACE 103

DEDICATION OF HIS ΡΙΝΝΑΟΕ1
(IV.)

THAT pinnace, friends, can boast that erst
'T was swiftest of its kind 3
Nor swam the bark whose fleetest burst
It could not leave behind ;
Whether the toiling rower's force 5
Or swelling sail impell'd its course.

This boast, it dares the shores that bound
The Adrian’s 2 stormy space,
The Cyclad 3 islands sea-girt round,
Bright Rhodes or rugged Thrace, 10
The wide Propontis 4 to gainsay,
Or still temPestuous Pontic bay.

There, ere it swam ’mid fleetest prows,
A grove of spreading trees

On high Cytorus' 5 hill, its boughs 15
Oft whisper’d in the breeze.

Amastris,6 pride of Pontic floods,

Cytorus, green with boxen woods,

1 Pointing out to some friends an old pinnace beached somewhere
near his villa on the shore of the Lago di Garda, Catullus tells how it
had once borne him home from Asia Minor. After mentioning the
most important places touched at or passed on the voyage, he dedi-
cates the hulk to Castor and Pollux, twin gods of navigation.

2 The Adriatic Sea. The voyage is traced backward from Italy to
Asia.

3 In the Aegean Sea.

4 Sea of Marmora.

⁶ A hill near the south coast of the Black Sea.

ὃ Α city on the Black Sea.
