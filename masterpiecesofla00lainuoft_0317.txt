TO MAECENAS 289

Forego vain pomps, nor gaze around
From the tall turret of thy palace home

On crowded marts, and summits temple-crowned‚
The smoke, the tumult, and the wealth of Rome.
Come, loved Maecenas, come ! 15

How oft in lowly cot
Uncurtained, nor with Tyrian purple spread,
Has weary state pillowed its aching head,
And smoothed its wriukled brow, all cares forgot?
Come to my frugal feast, and share my humble lot.
For now returning Cepheus ¹ shoots again 21
His fires long hid 3 now Procyon and the star
Of the untamed Lion blaze amain:
Now the light vapors in the heated air
Hang quiveriug: now the Shepherd leads 25
His panting flock to willow bordered meads
By river banks, or to those dells
Remote, profound, where rough Sylvanus ² dwells‚
Where by mute margins voiceless waters creep,
And the hushed Zephyrs sleep. 30
Too long by civil cares opprest
Snatch one short interval of rest,
Nor fear lest from the frozen north
Don’s arrowed thousands issue forth,
Or hordes from realms by Cyrus won, 35
Or Scythians from the rising sun.

Around the future Jove has cast
A veil like night: he gives us power

¹ The constellation of which Cepheus formed a part, rose on the

star of the Licn, on the :10th of July.

² The deity who presided over fields and forests.
