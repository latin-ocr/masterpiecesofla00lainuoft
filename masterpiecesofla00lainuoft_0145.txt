JULIA AND MANLIUS 117

VIII.

Bring her hither‚ bound to move,
Drawn and led with bands of love,

Like the tender twine 45
Which the searching ivy plics, ·
Clinging in a thousand ties

O'er the clasping vine.

IX.
Gentle virgins, ¹ you¹ besides,
Whom the like event beffides, 50
With the coming year3
Call on Hymen! call him now ἶ

Call aloud 1 A virgin now
Best befits his ear.

X.

‘⁶ Is there any deity 55
More beloved and. kind than he —
More disposed to bless ;
Worthy to be worshipp’d more 3
Master of a richer store
Of wealth and. happiness ? σο

ΧΙ.

“ Youth and age alike agree,
Serving and adoring thee,
The source of hope and care:
Care and hope alike engage
The wary parent sunk in age 65
And the restless heir.

1 A choir of girls had been chosen to sing the hymeneaI, which is
given in stanzas x.-xvi.
