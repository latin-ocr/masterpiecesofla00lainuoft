accepted his offer, and consented to purchase life by
sacrifieing the leader of their own ehoiee. Ambassa·
dors were sent to learn the pleasure of the conqueror.
He ordered the ehiefs of the garrison to be brought
out, and all the arms to be surrendered. The ohiefs
were led forth3 and Caesar, seated on his tribunal,
received their submission. VercingetoriX‚ mounted
on a gaily caparisoned chal-ger, rode round the tri-
bunal, and then, leaping to the ground, took off his
armor, laid down his sword‚ and bowed himself ab
Caesar's feet. He was sent to Rome, and imprisoned
in a dungeon. Six years later he was brought out, to

adorn Caesar's triumph3 and then he was put to
death.
