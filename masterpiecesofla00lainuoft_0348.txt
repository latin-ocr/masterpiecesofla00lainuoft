320 PROPER TIUS

Who measured out the year and bade the seasons
roll;

If realms beneath those fabled torments know,

Pangs without respite, fires that ever glow, 40

Earth's monster brood ¹ stretoh'd on their iron bed,

The hissing terrors round Aleoto’s ² head,

Soaree to nine acres Tityus’ bulk eonfined,

The triple dog that soares the shadowy kind,

All angry heaven infliots, or hell ean feel, 45

The pendent rock, Ixion's whirling wheel‚

Famine at feasts, and thirst amid the stream ;

Or are our fears th’ enthusiast’s empty dream,

And all the soenes, that hurt the grave’s repose‚

But piotured horror and poetic woes. 5⁰

These soft inglorious joys my hours engage3

Be love my youth's pursuit, and seience orown my
age.

You, whose young bosoms feel a nobler flame‚

Redeem what Crassus 3 lost, and vindicate his name.
Tfloms GRAY.
