310 TIBULLUS

While through the thirsty ground meandering run-
nels flowed.

There bees of sweets despoil the breathing spring, ⁵⁵

And to their cells the dulcet plunder bring.

The ploughman first to soothe the toilsome day

Chanted in measur'd feet his sylvan lay:

And, seed-time o’er, he first in blithesome vein

Piped to his household gods the hymning strain. 60

Then first the press with purple wine o'erran,

And cooling water made it fit for man.

The village lad first made a wreath of flowers

To deck in spring the tutelary powers :

Blest be the country, yearly there the plain 65

Yields, when the dog-star burns, the golden grain z

Thence too thy chorus, Bacchus, first began,

The painted clown first laid the tragic plan.

A goat, the leader of the shaggy throng,

The village sent it, recompensed the song. το

There too the sheep his woolly treasure wears ;

There too the swain his woolly treasure shears ;

This to the thrifty dame long work supplie53

The distaff hence, and basket took their rise.

Hence too the various labors of the loom, 75

Thy praise, Minerva,1 and Arachne's2 doom!

'Mid mountain herds, Love first drew vital air,

Unknown to man, and man had nought to fear3

'Gainst herds, his bow th' unskilful archer drew 3

Ah, my pieroed heart‚ an archer now too true! so

Now herds may roam untouch’d, 't is Cupid's joy,

The brave to vanquish, and to fix the coy.

1 Spinning‚ weaving, and similar feminine activities were under the
pati-onage of Minerva.

‘² The story is that Arachne was changed into a spider through the
machinatione. of Athene, who was jealous of her skill in weaving.
