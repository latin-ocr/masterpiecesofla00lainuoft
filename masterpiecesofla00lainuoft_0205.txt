LETTERS 177

days after they left you. Their arrival was most wel-
come to me: for while I took the greatest possible
pleasure in the letter of the kindest and most beloved
of fathers, still your most delightful letter put a fin-
ishing stroke to my joy. So ‘I no longer repent of
having suspended writing for a time, but am rather
rejoiced at it3 for Ι have reaped a great reward in
your kindness from my pen having been silent. I am
therefore exceedingly glad that you have unhesitat-
ingly accepted my excuse. Ι am sure, dearest Tiro,
that the reports about me which reach you answer
your best wishes and hopes. I will make them good,
and will do my best that this belief in me, which day
by day becomes more and more en evidence, shall be
doubled. VVherefore you may with confidence and as-
surance fulfil your promise of being the trumpeter of
my reputation. For the errors of my youth have caused
me so much remorse and suffering, that not only does
my heart shrink from what I did, my very ears abhor
the mention of it. And of this anguish and sorrow
I know and am assured that you have taken your
share. And I don’t wonder at it! for while you
wished me all success for my sake, you did so also for
your own 3 for I have ever meant you to be my part-
ner in all my good fortunes. Since, therefore, you
have suffered sorrow through me, I will now take
care that through me your joy shall be doubled.
Let me assure you that my very close attachment
to Cratippus1 is that of a son rather than a pupil:
for though Ι enjoy his lectures, I am also specially

edited the letters Ad Familiares. The modern tone of this letter,
written by a university student to his father⁷s man of business, will
be noticed. ’

1 The distinguished Peripatetic philosopher.
