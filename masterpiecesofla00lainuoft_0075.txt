SCENE 3.

Enter CHREMES from DEMIPHO'S house.

Chremes (not seez‘ny his wzfe). ’Se Demipho, have
you paid him the money?

Demipho. I looked after that at once.

Chremes. I wish you had n't. Oh 1 Ι see my wife !
I had almost said too much. ·

Demipho. Why do you wish I had n't paid it,
Chremes ?

Chremes. It does n't matter.

Demipho. What do you mean? Have you been
talking to the girl on whose account we 're bringing
Nausistrata ‘?

Chremes. I 've settled it all.

Demipho. What does she say?

Chremes. She ean't be taken away.

Demipho. Why ean’t she?

Chremes. Because they ’re in love with one an-
other.

Demipho. Wess, what ’s that to us ?

Chremes. A great deal3 and, besides, I find that
she 's related to us.

Demipho. What ⁴? You 're raving.

Chremes. You ’ll find ih so. Ι know what I ’m
saying 3 I 've just reoalled the matter.

Demipho. Are you in your right mind?

Nausistrata. Oh, I pray you, don't wrong a kins-
woman.

Demipho. She is n’t a kinswoman.

Chremes. Don’t contradict me. Her father went
under a different name3 that’s how you made the
mistake.
