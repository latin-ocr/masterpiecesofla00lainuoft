INNOCENCE
(odes, 1.‚ 22.)

FUSCUS, the man of life upright and pure,

Needeth nor javelin, nor bow of Moor,

Nor arrows tipped with venom deadlysure,
Loading his quiver t

Whether o’er Afric’s burning sands he rides,

Or frosty Cauoasus’ bleak mountain-sides,

Or wanders lonely, where Hydaspes 1 glides,
That storied river.

For as 1 strayed along the Sabine wood,
Singing my Lalage in careless mood, 10

Lo, al] at once a wolf before me stood,
Then turned and fled ε

Creature so huge did warlike Daunia 2 ne’er

Engender in her forests’ wildest lair,

Not J uba’s 3 land, parched nurse of lions, e’er 15
Such monster bred.

Plaoe me, where no life—laden summer breeze

Freshens the meads, or murmurs ’mongst the trees,

Where clouds oppress, and withering tempests freeze
From shore to shore3 πο

Place me beneath the sunbeams' fiereest glare‚
On arid sands‚ no dwelling anywhere ;

1 In India.
2 Apulia, Horace‘s native province.
3 King of Mauritania in northern Africa.
