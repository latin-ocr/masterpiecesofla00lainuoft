THE HONEY OF THE MUSES

Saying, ‘⁶ Why weep thy wane, O man?
WVert joyous e'en when life began,
When thy youth's sprightly freshets ran ?

“ N ay, all the joys thy life e'er knew
As poured into a sieve fell through,
And left thee but to rail and rue.''

Go, scol, as doth a well-filled guest
Sated of life : with tranquil breast
Take thine inheritance of rest.

Why seekest joys that soon must pale
Their feeble fires, and swell the tale
Of things of nought and no avail ?

Die, sleep! For all things are the same3
Tho’ spring now stir thy crescent frame‚
'T will wither : all things are the same.

never yet trodden by sole of man. I love to approach
the untasted springs and to quaff, I love to cull fresh
flowers and gather for my head a distinguished crown
from spots whence the muses have yet veiled the brows
of none3 first because I teach of great things and essay
to release the mind from the fast bonds of religious
scmples, and next because ou a dal-k subject I pen
such lucid verses o’erlaying all with the muses’ charm¹
