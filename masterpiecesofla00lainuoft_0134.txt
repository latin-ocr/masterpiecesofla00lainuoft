C'A TULL US

Count the grains of sand besprent 5
O'er Cyrene's ¹ spicy plain,

’Twixt old Battus’ ² monument
And the sweltering Hammon’s3 fane.

Count the silent stat-s of night,

That be ever watching, when 10
Lovers tasting stol'n delight

Dream not of their silent ken.

When these numbers thou hast told,
And hast kisses given as many,

Then I may, perchance‚ cry hold! 15
And no longer wish for any.

But, my love, there 's no amount
For a rage like mine too vast,
Which a curicus fool may count,

Or with tongue malignam: blast. 20
Sm THEODORE Mamm.
