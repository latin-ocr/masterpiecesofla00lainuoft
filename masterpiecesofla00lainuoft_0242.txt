214 VIRGIL

Of Bacchus fill its borders, overspread ιο

With fruitful fiocks and olives. Hence arose

The war-horse stepping proudly o’er the plain3

Hence thy white flocks‚ Clitumnus,1 and the bull,

Of victims mightiest, which full oft have led,

Bathed in thy sacred stream, the triumph-pomp 15

Of Romans to the temples of the gods.

Here blooms perpetual spring, and summer here

In months that are not summer's3 twice teem the
flocks ς

Twice doth the tree yield service of her fruit.

But ravening tigers come not nigh‚ nor breed 20

Of savage lion, nor aconite betrays

Its hapless gatherers, nor with sweep so vast

Doth the scaled serpent trail his endless coils

Along the ground, or wreathe him into spires.

Mark too her cities‚ so many and so proud‚ 25

Of mighty toil the achievement‚ town on town

Up rugged precipices heaved and reared‚

And rivers undergliding ancient walls.

Or should I celebrate the sea that laves 29

Her upper2 shores and lower? 3 or those broad lakes?

Thea, Larius‚4 greatest and, Benacus? thee

With biHowy uproar surging like the main ⁴?

Or sing her harbors‚ and the barrier cast

Athwart the Lucrine‚⁶ and how ocean chafes

With mighty bellowings, where the Julian wave 35

1 A river of Umbria, in the neighborhood of which a famous breed
of white cattle was reared.

² The Adriatic Sea. 8 The Tyrrhenian Sea.

⁴³ Lago di Como. 5 Lago di Garda.

⁶ Lucrinus and Avernus were two small lakes on the Campanian
coast, connected with the sea and with one another by a channel‚ and
used as a harbor. A strong breakwater had been built by Octavian
on the strip of land that separated Lucrinus from the sea.
