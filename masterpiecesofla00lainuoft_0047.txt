PHORMJO 19

Phormio. And Phanium is left alone?

Geta. Yes.

Phormio. And the old gentleman is angry?

Geta. Furious.

Phormio (to himsegf). Upon you alone, Phormio,
devolves the conduct of this affair3 you're the one
who has made this dish, and you 're the one who must
eat it. Set about it then!

Geta. Pmy, help us.

Phormio (to himser). Suppose he asks ——

Geta. We 're depending wholly on you.

Phormio (to himseff). But see! that if he re-
plies --

Geta. It was you who drove him to it.

Phormio (to himself). I have it, I think.

Geta. Do help us.

Phormio. Bring the old fellow out. I 've all my
plans arranged.

Geta. What are you going to do‘?

Phormio. Just what you want ine to do,—have
Phanium stay where she is, free Antipho from blame,
turn aside the current of the old man's wrath upon
myself.

Geta. You 're a pluoky fellow, and a friend in-
deed. But, Phormio, I ’m often afraid that your
dare-devil ways will land you in the stoc-ks some day.

Phormio. Not a bit of it. I've had experience,
and can see my way clearly now. Just think of all
the people Ι 've beaten out of their very lives—for-
eigners and citizens: the better I know the way, the
oftener I try it. Come, tell me now, have you ever
heard of any action for assault being brought against
me ?

Ι Geta. How do you account for that?
