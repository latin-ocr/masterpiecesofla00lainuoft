xii INTRODUCTION

Conventional at first and having more than a modi-
cum of the old persona] clement, it presently adopted
broader methods, and by its substitution of types for
individuals, by its potentialities of suggestion, its crea-
tion of atmosphere, it gained in subtlety what it lost

Juvenal, whose style, strongly influenced by the stand-

sententiae. His rhetoric is sometimes pompous, on
