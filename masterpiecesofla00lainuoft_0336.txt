308 TIBULLUS

F or me, while I possess one plenteous year,

I 'll wealth and meagre want alike despise.

A RURAL FESTIVAL¹

(11. 1.)

ATTEND! and favor! as our sires ordain‚
The fields we lustrate, and the rising grain :
Come, Bacchus, and thy horns with grapes surround3
Come, Ceres, with thy wheaten garland erowned3
This hallow'd. day suspend each swain his toil, 5
Rest let the plough, and rest th’ uncultured soil:
Unyoke the steer, his raoks heap high with hay,
And deek with wreaths his honest front to-day.
Be all your thoughts to this grand work applied l
And lay, ye thrifty fair, your wool aside! ιο
Hence Ι command you mortals from the rite,
Who spent in amorous blandishment the night,
The verna] powers in chastity delight.
But come, ye pure, in spotless garbs array'd!
For you the solemn festival is made3 15
Come! follow thriee the vietim round the lands!
In running water purify your hands l
See to the flames the willing vietim come 1
Ye swains with olive erown'd‚ be dumb! be dumb!
“ From ills, Ο sylvan gods, our limits shield, 20
To-day we purge the farmer and the field ;
Oh let no weeds destroy the rising grain3
By no fell prowler be the lamblzin slain 3

1 The central theme of this elegy is the celebration of the Ambar-
valia, which took place annually in April. Its purpose was the
purification of the fields.
