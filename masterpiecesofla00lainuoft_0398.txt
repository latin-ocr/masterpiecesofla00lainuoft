At length, after men and beasts were heartily fa-
tigued to no purpose, they fixed a camp on the summit,
having with very great difficulty cleared even the
ground which that required, so great was the quantity
of snow to be dug and carried off. The soldiers were
then employed to make a way down the steep, through
which alone it was possible to effect a passage 3 and as

spent about this rock, during which the cattle were
nearly destroyed by hunger 3 for the summits are for the
most part bare, and whatever little pasture there might
have been was covered with snow. In the lower parts
are valleys and some hills, which, enjoying the benefit
of the sun, with rivulets at the side of the woods, are
