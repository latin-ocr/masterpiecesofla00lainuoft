ROME 441

In these cursed walls, devote alone to gain,
When do the poor a wealthy wife obtain? 220
When are they named in wills ἱ) When called to share
The aedile's ¹ couneil, and assist the ehair?
Long since should they have risen, thus slighted,

s urned
And leftp their home, but—not to have returned 1
Depressed by indigenae, the good and wise 225

In every elime by painful efforts rise3
Here by more painful still, where scanty eheer,
Poor lodging, mean attendanee —- all is dear.
In earthenware he seorns at Rome to eat,
Who, called abruptly to the Marsian's 2 seat, 230
From such well pleased would take his simple food,
Nor blush to wear the oheap Venetian hood.
There 's many a part of Italy, 't is said,
Where none assume the toga but the dead ε
There, when the toil foregone and annual play 2³5
Mark from the rest some high and solemn day,
To theatres of turf the rustios throng,
Charmed with the faroe that charmed their sires so
long ;
While the pale infant, of the mask3 in dread,
Hides in his mother-'s breast his little head. 240
No modes of dress high birth distinguish there3
All ranks, all orders, the same habit wear,
And the dread aedile’s dignity is known,
O sacred badge! by his white garb alone.
But here, beyond our power arrayed we go, 245
In all the gay varieties of show;

1 In his funetion as a police magistrate.

² The Marsi, whose country lay among the Apennines, east of
Rome, were proverbial for the simplicity of their lives.

⁸ Masks were worn by the aetors.
