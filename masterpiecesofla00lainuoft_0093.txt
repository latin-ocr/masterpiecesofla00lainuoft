LUCRETJUS 65

references to the master show a rare earnestness. Epi-
curus is to him something more than mortal‚—something
of a god. He it was who first pointed out the way of
truth, who showed a light in the darkness, who made hap-
piness possible for men. The ultra sombre, almost morbid
view of life that we find in many passages of the poem is
in part due to the same impassioned zeal for the doctrines
he was preaching3 for while his keen sense of the misery
and suffering in the world had much to do with his embrac-
ing Epicureanism in the first place, the enthusiasm with
which he embraced it tended to make him exaggerate the
evils which he was combatting. The note sounded in the
second book (v. 578 πᾳ), “ nor did night ever follow
day, or morning night, that heard not, mingling with the
eries of sickly infants, wailings the attendants on death and
black funeral’' recurs again and again. In depicting the
(Ῑίΐῖψξρεοῆἓῃᾳωϊθ he stands 111 the first rank among
Roman poets. His descriptions, introduced from time to
tffloeeve the tension of philosophie argument, are
marked by an accuracy, a truthfulness a staitling yivid·
ness, that could come only from highly trained powers of
obmfflut they have besides the charm which springs
fi om a genuine feeling for the beauty of the external world.
Nor does the compression which so many of them show de-
tract at all from their effectiveness. The “ shells that paint
the lap of earth, where the sea with gentle waves beats on
the thirsty sand of the winding shore,'’ the “grey-green
strip of olives running between vineyards,'' — such descrip-
tions as these linger in the memory, when more elaborate
pictures might fail.

On the side of language Lucretius was hampered by the
fact that Latin had not in his time developed a philosophi-
cal voeabulary. So we find him complaining of the “pov-
erty of the Latin language.'’ The Latin hexameter, too,
was a medium which, although it had been used before by
Ennius, had not as yet attained to any very great degree
of flexibility.
