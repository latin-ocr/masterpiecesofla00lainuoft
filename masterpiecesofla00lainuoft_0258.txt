Rich with the resinous pine and in oak—hewn timbers
cased

Rises a giant pyre, in its sides dax-k foliage laced3

Planted in front stand branches of cypress, gifts to

the grave 3 220
Over it hang for adornment the gleaming arms of the
rav .
Some hleat fiuntain water, the bubbling caldron pre-
Clay-colllnllfflbs then wash and anoint. Wail sounds
on the air.
Dirge at an end, the departed is placed on the funeral
O'er hiffclfiey fling bright raiment, the wonted attire
of the dead. 225
Others shoulder the ponderous bier, sad service of
death 3

Some in ancestral fashion the lighted torches beneath
Hold with averted eyes. High blaze on the burning

pyr&

lucense, funeral viands, and oil outpoured on ⁴ the
fire.

After the ashes have fallen and flames are leaping no
more, 230

Wine on the smouldering relics and cinders thirsty
they pour.

N ext in a vessel of brass Corynaeus ¹ gathers the
bones,

Thrice bears pure spring water around Troy’s sorrow-
ing sons,

Sprinkles it o'er them in dew, from the bough of an
olive in bloom‚ 234

Gives lustration to all, then bids farewell to the tomb.

¹ One of Aeneas' companions.
