WVhere the divine revelation ordains our gifts to be

Side b;asli(de at her bidding they traverse the region

Over tffg dliISzOEdZ'ce hasten, and now draw nigh to the

Frontindgootlhse gates Aeneas stands, fresh water 13⁴2
pours

Over his limbs, and the branoh on the portal hangs
as she bade.

After the rite is completed, the gift to the goddess
addoessed,

Now at the last they come to the realms where J oy
has her throne 3

Sweet green glades in the Fortunate Forests‚ abodes
of the blest‚ 645

Fields in an ampler ether, a light more glorious
dressed,

Lit evermore with their own bright stars and a sun
of their own.

Some are training their limbs on the wrestling-green,
and compete

Gaily in sport on the yeHow arenas, some with their
feet

Treading their choral measures, or singing the hymns
of the god3 650

While their Thracian priest,1 in a sacred robe that
trails‚

Chants them the air with the seven sweet notes of his
musical scales,

Now with his fingers striking, and now with his ivory
rod.

Orpheus.
