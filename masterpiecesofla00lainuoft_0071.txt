PHORMJO 43

Chremes. Look at me.

Sophrona. For Heaven’s sake, is it Stilpo?

Chremes. N o.

Sophrona. You deny it?

Chremes. Pray, Sophrona, come a little away from
the door of that house, and don't ever eall me by that
name again.

Sophrona. What? Are n't you the man you al-
ways said you were?

Chremes. Hush 1

Sophrona. Why do you fear that door?

Chremes. I 've a savage wife eaged up there. I
used to eall myself by that false name lest you might
inadvertently talk too much, and so somehow it might
come to her earS.

Sophrona. Then, by the powers, that 's why we
poor women eould never find you here in Athens.

Chremes. But tell me, what have you to do with
that house you ’ve just left? VVhere are my wife and
daughter?

Sophrona. Oh, dear me 1

Chremes. What ’s the matter? Are n’t they
alive ‘?

Sophrona. Your daughter is, but all this trouble
killed her mother.

Chremes. That 's too bad!

Sophrona. So I ——— being an old woman, all alone,
poor, and friendless—did the best I eould for the
girl, and married her to the young master of this
house.

Chremes. What, to Antipho?

Sophrona. Yes, that 's the man.

Chremes. What, has he two wives?

Sophrona. No, only this one.
