340 Ο VI D

Too sparely ballasted, across the deep

Unsteady drives, the 011311οὺ now, unpressed

By its due burden, reels and rocks, and seems

As empty to those coursers, quiek to snatch

Their liberty. Wild dashing on, they quit 185
The beaten traok, and all control disown.

Cold tremors seize the youth : — no more he knows
Which rein to try, or where his road, though vain

’T were nOW, when all command is lost, to know.
Now first those heavenly Oxen burned with heat 190
Unfelt before, and vainly longed to plunge

Beneath the wave denied them3 — and the Snake

N ighest the icy Pole, till now with cold

Inert, and terrible to none, conceived

Strange fury from the rays. Even thou, they say, 195
Alarmed didst fly, Bootes, slow albeit:

Of movement by thy tardy wain delayed.

But when the hapless Phaethon looked down

From Heaven ‘co Earth, so wide, so far below,
Together knocked his knees, and blanched his eheeks,
And darkness, born of too much light, his eyes 201
Confounded. Would his hand had ne’er essayed
Those steeds to rule! Ah, would he ne’er had won
With fatal prayer this proof of heavenly birth,
Content with Merops for a sire! As drives 205
Some bark, when Boreas rageS, and the helm

The o'ermastered pilot quits, nor hope 1135 more,
Save in his prayers and Gods — so headlong now
The youth is borne. Behind him spreads the traok
Of Heaven already passed — before him lies 210
A wider yet! Both measuring, now with look
Sti-ained to ‘chat west he ne'er is doomed to reaeh —
Now eastward —— paralyzed in blank despair

He stands —— the loose reins idle in his hands
