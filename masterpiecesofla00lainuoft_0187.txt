LETTERS 159

have given us that strong hope of peace, of which, in
sole reliance on you, Ι was assuring every one. But I
must inform you that your old enemies 1 — now posing
as your friends—have received a stunning blow by
this dispatch, and, being disappointed in the high
hopes they were entertaining‚ are thoroughly depressed.
Though your private letter to me contained a some—
what slight expression of your affection, yet I can
assure you it gave me pleasure: for there is nothing
in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in
the consciousness of serving my friends3 and if on
any occasion I do not meet with an adequate return,
Ι am not at all sorry to have the balance of kind-
ness in my favor. Of this Ι feel no doubt—even
if my extraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to
unite you to me ——that the interests of the state
will certainly effect a mutual attachment and coalition
between us. To let you know, however, what I missed
in your letter I will write with the candor which my
own disposition and our common friendship demand.
I did expect some congratulation in your letter on my
achievements,2 for the sake at once of the ties between
us and of the Republic. This Ι presume to have
been omitted by you from a sear of hurting any one’s
feelings. But let me tell you that what I did for the
salvation of the country is approved by the judgment
and testimony of the whole world. You are a much
greater man than Africanus? but Ι am not much infe-
rior to Laelius either 3 and when you come home you
will recognize that I have acted with such prudence

1 Caesar and his party.

2 Cicero had written him an account of his suppression of the Cati-
linarian conspiracy.

⁸ Scipio, whose name, together with that of Laelius, has been al-
ready mentioned in connection with the dialogue On Friendslzip.
