7 2 LUCRETJUS

And only twain ε and these are to be free —
Your minds from terror, and your bones from pain.

VI.

Unailing limbs, a calm unanxious breast —

Grant Nature these, and she will do the rest.
Nature will bring you, be you rich or poor,

Perhaps not much— at all events her best.

VII,

What though no statued youths from wall and wall
Strew light along your midnight festival,

With golden hands, nor beams from Lebanon
Keep the lyre's languor lingering through the hall,

VIII.

Yours is the table 'neath the high-whispering trees 3
Yours is the lyre of leaf and stream and breeze‚

The golden fiagon, and the echoing dome —
Lapped in the Spring‚ what care you then for these?

IX.

Sleep is no sweeter on the ivory bed
Than yours on moss ; and fever's shafts are sped

As clean through silks damasked for dreaming
As throlhlgffst'he hood that wraps the poor man's head.

X.

Yields to his body not one sense the more,
Nor any aohe or fever of them all

Is barred out by bronze gates or janitor —
