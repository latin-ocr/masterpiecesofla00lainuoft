knowing. Moreover, I ’m afraid of this coming some-
how to my wife's ears, and if that happens there 's
nothing left for me to do but to clear out and run
away from home. I’ve only myself‚ of all my be-
longings, that Ι can eall my own.

Demipho. Ι know, and it makes me anxious. But
I 'll never tire of trying to aeoomplish what Ι promised.

SCENE 2.
Enter GETA.

Geta. Phormio is the cleverest man I ’ve ever known.
I went to him to tell him that money was wanted, and
how it was to be got. Before Ι was half through, he
understood. He was delighted, praised me, inquired
where the old gentleman was, and thanked Heaven
thathe had been given an opportunity of proving
himself no less a friend to Phaedria than he had been
to Antipho. Ι told him to wait for me at the market-
plaoe‚ and Ι would bring Demipho there. But there ’s
the old gentleman himself now! And who is that
behind him? Whewl it ’s Phaedria's father come
home! But why should I be afraid, simpleton that Ι
am? Because I ’ve got two men to cheat instead of
one? It ’s better, I take it, to have two strings to
one’s bow. I’ll ask Demipho for the money, as Ι
intended to do 3 if he gives it to me, all right. If Ι
ean get nothing out of him, then I ’ll taokle the new-

comer.
SCENE 3.

Enter ANTIPHO, umbserved, from DEM1PHo's house.

Antipho. Ι wonder how soon Geta will be back.
But I see my uncle standing with my father! Heav-
ens! how I fear what his return may mean for me 1
