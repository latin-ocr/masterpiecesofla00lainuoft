I’HORMIO 27

Semne 4.

Enter Arx-nmio.

Antipho. There 's no doubt about it, Antipho,
you ’re a great deal to blame for your eowardiee.
Just think of going off as you did and leaving your
very life to be protected by others! Did you think
that others would look after your interests better than
yourself? However other matters stood, you certainly
ought to have done your best for her whom you now
have at home, and seen to it that she should not be
deeeived and harmed through you. All her hopes and
resources‚ poor thing, rest in you alone.

Geta (cominyforward). well, as a matter of fact,
master, we ’ve been blaming you this long time for
going away.

Antipho. You ’re the very man I was looking for.

Θεία. But we have n't ou that account been any
the less zealous in your cause.

Antipho. Tell me, pray, how stand my affairs and
my fortune ‘? Does my father suspect anything‘?

Θεία. Nothing as yet.

Antipho. Is there any hope for the future ‘?

Geta. I don’t knOW.

Antipho. Oh, dearl

Geta. Except that Phaedria has never ceased to
fight for you.

Antipho. Nothing new in him.

Geta. And Phormio has shown himself as strenu-
ous in this as in other matters.

Antipho. What has he done?

Θεία. He sileneed the old gentleman‚ who was in
a great rage.
