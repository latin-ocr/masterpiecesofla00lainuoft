154 CICERO

mere fictitious representation. What may we suppose
that they would have done, had the same thing 06-
curred in real life? In that case Nature herself dis-
played her power, when 111611 recognized that as rightly
done by another, which they would not have had the
courage to do themselves. Thus far, to the utmost of
my ability, as it seems to me, I have given you my
sentiments concerning friendship. If there is more
to be said, as I think that there is, endeavor to obtain
it, if you see fit, 01 those who are wont to discuss such
subjects.

Fannius. But we would rather have it from you.
Although Ι have often consulted those philosophers
also, and have listened to them not unwillingly, yet
the thread 01 your discourse differs sornewhat from
that 01 theirs.

Scaevola. You would say so all the more, Fannius,
had you been present in Seipio's gat-den at that dis-
cussion about the republic‚ and heard what an advo-
cate 01 justice 116 showed himself in answer to the
elaborate speech of Philus.

F annius. It was indeed easy 101· the man pre'e‘mi-
nently just to defend justice.

Scaevola. As to friendship‚ then, is not its defence
easy for him who has won the highest celebrity1 on
the ground 01 friendship maintained with preeminent
faithfulness‚ consistency‚ and probity‘?

Laelius. This is, indeed, the employing of force 3 for
what matters the way in which you eompel me? You
at any rate do compel me3 for it is both hard and
unfair not to comply with the wishes 01 0116’3 sons-
in-law, especially 111 a case that merits favorable 6011-
sideration.

¹ He refers to the great friendship of Laelius aud Scipio.
