ROME 437

A barbarous mistress, an outlandish love 3
Hie to the Circus! there in crowds they stand, 105
Tires on their head and timbrels in their hand.

Thy rustic, Mars, the trechedipna 1 wears,
And on his breast, smeared with ceroma,2 bears
A paltry prize, well pleased ; while every land,
Sicyon, and Amydon, and Alaband, 110
Tralles, and Samos, and a thousand more,
Thrive on his indolence, and daily pour
Their starving myriads forth : hither they come,
And batten on the genial soil of Rome 3
Minions, then lords, of every princely dome! 115
A flattering, cringing, treacherous, artful race,
Of torrent tongue, and never-blushing face 3
A Protean 3 tribe, one knows not what to call,
Which shifts to every form, and shines in all:
Grammarian, painter, augur, rhetorician, 120
Rope-dancer, conjurer, fiddler, and physician‚
All trades his own your hungry Greekling counts 3
And bid him mount the sky — the sky he mounts ἶ
You smile —was ’t a barbarian, then, that flew?
No, 't was a Greek ; ’t was an Athenian,4 too 1 125
Bear with their state who will ε for I disdain
To feed their upstart pride, or swell their train :
Slaves, that in Syrian lighters stowed so late
With figs and prunes (an inauspicious height),
Already see their saith preferred to mine, 130
And sit above me! and before me sign 15
That on the Aventine6 Ι first drew air,

¹ Greek shoes. 2 A mixture of wax, oil, and clay.
3 Like Proteus, able to assume different forms.
4 Daedalus.

⁵ Take a higher place at dinner, and have precedence in signing
a document.

⁶ One of the hills of Rome.
