own. Moreover‚ an extraordinary coincidence has
occurred which seems to support my opinion and to
gual-antee your kindness. For just as I was speaking
to our friend Balbus about this very Trebatius at my
house, with more than usual earnestness, a letter from
you was handed to me, at the end of which you say :
“Miscinius Rufus, whom you recommend to me, I
will make king of Gaul, or, if you choose, put him
under the care of Lepta.l Send me some one else to
promote.'’ I and Balbus both lifted our hands in
surprise: it came so exactly in the nick of time, that
it appeared to be less the result of mere chance than
something providential. I therefore send you Treba-
tius, and 011 two grounds, first that it was my spon-
taneous idea to send him, and secondly, because you
have invited me to do so. Ι would beg you, dear
Caesar, to receive him with such a display of kind-
ness as to concentrate 011 1115 single person all that
you can be possibly induced to bestow for my sake
upon my friends. As for him I guarantee — not in the
sense of that hackneyed expression of mine, at which,
when Ι used it in writing to you about Milo, you very
properly jested, but 111 good Roman language such as
sober men use—that no honester, better, or more
modest man exists. Added to this, he is at the top
of his profession as a jurisconsult, possesses an un-
equalled memory, and the most profound learning.
For such a man Ι ask neither a tribuneship, prefec-
ture, nor any definite office, Ι ask only your good-will
and liberality: and yet I do not wish to prevent your
complimenting him, if it so please you, with even
these marks of distinction. In fact, Ι transfer him
entirely from my hand, so to spcak, to yours, which is
