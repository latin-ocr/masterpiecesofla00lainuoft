HORA ΟΕ 275

of the third book. Another class consists of those in which
we see the poet in relation to his friends. As examples
may be cited from the first book the third, in which he gives
Godspeed to the ship on which Virgil sailed for Greece‚ the
twentieth‚ an invitation to Maecenas to visit him at his Sa-
bine farm, and the twenty-ninth‚ in which he rallies Iccius
on his military ambition. The Odes are arranged within
the different books with regard to variety of theme and
metre. In the Epodes, which stand first, in order of com-
position, οἱ all the poet‘s works, and which are written in
the iambic metre, there is a strong element of invective,
several of them being directed against individuals who in
one way or another had aroused the poet's ire, e. 9., the
parvenu whose ambition was to attract attention on the Sacra
Via by his elaborate dress (IV.)‚ the alleged sorceress Cani-
dia (V.), and the writer who made better men than himself
the objects of his libellous attacks (VI.). The tone of the
Satires is much more moderate. These are in hexameters,
and are delightful sketches of different phases of Roman lit-
erary and social conditions. Among the most famous is the
fifth of the first book, which describes the various incidents
of a journey from Rome to Brundisium which Horace took
with Maecenas, Virgil, and other well-known men. The
ninth of the same book is a delightfully humorous account
of Horace’s encounter with a bore on the Sacra Via. The
tenth deals with literary subjects. In the second book the
sixth contrasts life in the country and life in the town, the
eighth gives a picture of a parvenu’s dinner party. In the
first book of the Epistles we have perhaps the poet's best
work. Some of the themes are not unlike those treated in
the Satires, but the style, informal and easy as ever, has
a still subtler charin that comes from greater maturity.
The second book is confined to literary topics, the third
epistle being the famous Art of Poetry, Horace's most pre-
tentious essay in the field of litei-ary criticism.
