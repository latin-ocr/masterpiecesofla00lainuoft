THE SIEGE OF ALESIA 187

Its only effect was to stimulate his inventive genius.
If he could keep the army of Vercingetorix from
breaking out, he could also keep the relieving force
from breaking in. The most vulnerable part of his
position was the open meadow on the western side of
the mountain. Across this expanse, from the Oze to
the Ozerain, a trench was dug, twenty feet wide with
perpendicular sides, to prevent the enemy from at-
tacking the troops while they were constructing the
proper works. About four hundred yards behind
the ends of this trench‚ but bending outwards, was
traced the line of contravallation, which was prolonged
so as to surround Alesia, and ran along the lower slopes
of the encircling hills and across the valley of the
Rabutin. First of all, two parallel trenches were (lug,
each fifteen feet wide and eight feet deep, the outer
of which extended only across the plain, while the in-
ner, embracing the whole circuit of the hill, was filled,
where the level permitted, with water drawn from the
Ozerain and the Rabutin. Just behind the outer
trench‚ and also behind that portion of the other which
encompassed the rest of the position, a rampart was
erected, surmounted by a palisade, with an embattled
fence of wattle-work in front, from the bottom of
which projected stout forked branches. The combined
height of rampart and palisade was twelve feet.
Wooden towers were erected upon the western sec-
tion of the rampart at intervals of eighty feet, and
also at certain points along the rest of the contra-
vallation.

To repel the reinforcements for which Vercingetorix
had sent, a line of works somewhat similar to these,
forming the circumvallation, was traced .along the
heights of Flavigny, Pevenel and Bussy, and across the
