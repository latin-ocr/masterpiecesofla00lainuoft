132 CICERO

to have a fresh charge added on to it? What kind
of a time was that to choose for administering poison,
on such a day and before such a number of people?
By whom, moreover, was it offered? VVhere was it
procured‘? What about the stoppage of the cup?
And why was it not offered afresh‘? There is much
that might be said ; but I shall not lay myself open to
the charge of wishing to say something while saying
nothing. The facts are their own defence. I assert
that the youth spoken of, who, according to you, ex-
pired immediately after draining the cup, did not die
on that day at all. It is a monstrous accusation and
a shameless falsehood. I say that when he came to
the breakfast he was suffering from indigestion; he
indulged his appetites too freely at the time, as young
men like him wiH do 3 and he died in consequence after
a few days’ illuess. tho will vouch for this? The
same man who will vouch for his own sorrow—his
father —the young man's father, I repeat. He who
for his grief of heart could have been induced by a
very faint suspicion to come forward on the other side
as a witness against A. Cluentius, gives him the sup-
port of his testimony instead. Read it. And do you,
sir,l if you please, stand up for a little, and endure the
pang of this indispensable allusion 3 on which I shall
not linger any longer, since by acting like the excellent
man you are, you have not permitted your sorrow to
involve the guiltless in the calamity of a baseless ao-
cusation.

I have still one similar charge remaining, gentlemen,
which will enable you thoroughly to appreciate the
truth of what I said in the beginning of my speech—
that whatever 111isf01·tune A. Cluentius has seen during

¹ Balbutius' father.
