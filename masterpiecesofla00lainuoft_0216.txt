intervening valleys and the plain. The circuit of this
line was fully ten miles.

But even these works were not deemed sufficient.
The Gauls made frequent and furious sallies. Com-
paratively few of the Romans were available as com-
batants3 for many had to go in quest of corn and
timber, while others were laboring on the works.
Caesar therefore invented various subsidiary defences.
Ditches, five feet deep, were dug just inside the large
moat that was filled with water3 and five rows of
strong boughs were fixed in each, with one end protrud-
ing above ground, sharpened and with the branches
projecting so as to form a kind of abatis. In front
of them and rising a few inches above the ground, but
purposely concealed by brushwood, were sharp pointed
logs embedded in small pits. In front of these again,
comealed, but barely concealed, beneath the turf,
were barbed spikes fixed in pieces of wood. Fringed
by these formidable defences, Caesar expected that
contravallation and circumvallation would be alike
impregnable.

Nevertloeless, the struggle was likely to be pro-
longed3 and it would certainly tax to the utmost the
endurance and the fighting power of the men. As
soon as the relieving army should arrive, the Romans
would be hemmed in between two desperate enemies.
Every moment for preparation was precious. Flying
parties scoured the country for corn and provender:
but they could not collect a sufficient supply ; and the
rations had to be reduced. Every day,—even by
night, when the moon was up, or in the glow of the
watch-fires, —- the besieged could see the indefatigable
legionaries laboring to finish their works before the
time for the great hazard should arrive.
