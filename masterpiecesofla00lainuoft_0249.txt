AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 221

Here may the evil fate of the Trojans leave us at last l

Spare, for ’t is meroy's hour, this remnant of Per-
gama's 1 raee, 65

Gods and goddesses all, whose jealous eyes in the past

Looked upon Ilion’s ¹ glories! From thee I implore
one grace, ’

Prophet of Heaven, dark seer of the future. Grant
us the debt,

Long by the destinies owed us — a, kingdom promised
of yore —

F oot upon Latium's borders at length may Teucrians
set, ἰο

Bearing their household gods by the tempests tossed
evermore Ῐ

Ι, their votary grateful, in Phoebus’ and Trivia‘s2
pralse

Hewn from the solid marble a glorious fane will raise,

Call by Apollo’s name his festival. Also for thee

Shall in our future kingdom a shrine imperial be. 75

There shall thine own dark sayings, the mystie fates
of our line,

Gracious seer, be installed, and a priesthood chosen
be thine.

Only entrust not to leaves thy propheoy, maiden
divine,

Lest in disorder, the light winds’ sport, they be
driven on the air3

Chant thyself the prediction.” His lips here ended
from prayer. so

Still untamed of Apollo, to stature terrible grown,
Raves the prophetie maid in her cavern, fain to de-
throne

¹ Troy. 2 Diana.
