DIDO TO AENEAS 327

DIDO TO AENEASl

(Heroides, VII.)

SO, on Maeander's 2 banks‚ when death is nigh,

The mournful swan sings her own elegy.

Not that I hope (for oh, that hope were vain l)

By words your lost affection to regain3

But, having lost whate’er was worth my care, 5
Why should I fear to lose a dying prayer?

'T is then resolved poor Dido must be left,

Of life, of honor, and of love bereft1

While you, with loosened sails, and vows, prepare

Το seek a land that flies the searcher’s care; 10
Nor can my rising towers your flight restrain‚

Nor my new empire, offered you in vain.

Built walls you shun‚ unbuilt you seek ; that land

Is yet to conquer, but you this command.

Suppose you lauded where your wish designed‚ 15
Think what reception foreigners would find,

What people is so void of common sense,

To vote succession from a native prince ?

Yet there new sceptres and new loves you seek,

New vows to plight‚ and plighted vows to break. 20
When will your towers the height of Carthage know ἶ)
Or when your eyes discern such crowds below?

1 The visit to Carthage was one of the most important episodes
in the long voyage of Aeneas and his Trojaus fron] Troy to Italy.
Driven by a storm ou the coast of Africa, they had been hospitably
entertained by Queen Dido. then, after some time, Aeneas an—
nounced his intention to depart, the queen, loving him, urged him to
remain and share her kingdom with her. He, however, refused, and
was making his final preparations to leave the country, when she sent

him this letter as a last appeal.
