CUSTOMS OF THE GERMANS 409

sion of a certain tract proportioned to its number of
hands ; allotments are afterwards made to individuals
according to their rank and dignity. In so extensive
a country, where there is no want of land, the parti-
tion is easily made. The ground tilled in one year
lies fallow the next, and a sufficient quantity always
remains‚ the labor of the people being by no means
adequate to the extent or fertility of the soil. Nor
have they the skill to make orchard plantations‚ to en-
close the meadow grounds, or to lay out and water
gardens. From the earth they demand nothing but
grain. Hence their year is not, as with the Romans,
divided into four seasons. They have distinct ideas
of winter, spring, and summer, and their language has
terms for each; but they neither know the blessings
nor the name of autumn.

Their funerals have neither pomp nor vain ambition.
When the bodies of illustrious men are to be burned,
they choose a particular kind of wood for the purpose,
and have no other attention. The funeral pile is
neither strewed with garments nor enriched with fra-
grant spices. The arms of the deceased are committed
to the flames, and sometimes his horse. A mound of
turf is raised to his memory 3 and this, in their opin-
ion, is a better sepulchre than those structures of la-
bored grandeur which display the weakness of human
vanity, and are at best a bui-den to the dead. Tears
and lamentations are soon at an end, but their regret
does not so easily wear away. To grieve for the de·
parted is comely in the softer seX. The women weep
for their friends 3 the men remember them.
