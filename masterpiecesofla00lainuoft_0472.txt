The far-famcd boast of Polyclcte ¹ and Grcece 3
This, ornaments which grac-ed of old the fane
Of Asia's gods; that, figured plate and plain3 ³10
This, cases, books, and busts the shelves to grace,
And piles of coin his specie to replace.
So much the childless Persian 2 swells his store,
(Though deemed the richest of the rich before)
That all ascribe the flames to thirst of pest, ³15
And swear Asturius fired his house himself.

Ο, 113(1 you from the Circus 3 power to fly,
In many a halcyon village might you buy
Some elegant retreat, for what will here
Scarce hire a gloomy dungeon through the year! 320
There wells by nature formed, which need no rope,
No laboring arm to crane their waters up,
Around your lawn their facile streams shall shower‚
And cheer the springing plant and opening flower.
There live delighted with the rustic's lot, ³25
And till with your own hands the little spot 3
The little spot shall yield you large amends,
And glad with many a feast your Samian friends.4
And sure, in any corner we can get,
To call one lizard ours is something yet! 330

Flushed with a mass of undigested food,
Which clods the stomach and inflames the blood,
that cmwds, with watching wearied and o’erpoest,
Curse the slow hours, and die for want of rest!
For who can hope his languid lids to close, 335
