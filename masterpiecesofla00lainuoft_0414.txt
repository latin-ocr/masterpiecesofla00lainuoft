observed3 but, perceiving that to be guarded, and
every avenue round to be shut by a body of soldiers,
he called for poison, which he had long kept in readi-
ness for such an event, and said, “ Let us release the
Romans from their long anxiety, since they have not
patience to wait for the death of an old man. F lamini-
nus will gain no very great or memorable victory over
one unarmed and betrayed. that an alteration has
taken place in the behavior of the Roman people,
this day affords abundant proof. Their fathers gave
warning to Pyrrhus, their armed foe, then heading
an army against them in Italy, to beware of poison.
The present generation have sent an ambassador, of
consular rank, to persuade Prusias villanously to mur-
der his guest.’' Then imprecating curses 'on the head
of Prusias, and on his kingdom, and calling on the
gods, the avengers of violated hospitality, to witness
his breach of faith‚ he drank off the content-s of the
cup. In this manner did Hannibal end his life.
