Old Tellus‚¹ ocean-girdled, ——all her founts

Or dried or in her bosom shrunk, — upraised

Her parching brow, and, shading from her eyes

With outspread hand the glare, and by her fears

Shaken to lesser bulk and lower place 32⁰

Than erst she held, with gasping aeeents spake.

‘⁶ O thou, of Gods the Sovereign 1 2 if thy will

Be thus, and I this fate have merited,

Why linger yet thy lightnings‘? If by fire

I perish‚ let it be by thine 1 My doom 325

Will come the easier from thy hand. The prayer

Thou seest how seat-ee my parehing lips have strength

To urge. My brows are seorehed l my eyes are
seared

And blind with ashes 1 Oh! is this the meed

Of all my faithful duty? But for this 330

Have I endured‚ the long year through, the tooth

Of plough and gnawing harrow‘? But for this

Borne for the herd its pasture, for the raoe

Of men my hawests, for the Gods themselves 3³4

Their incense? Say my doom is just 3 — but what,

What hath my Brother 3 done? Why thus from
Heaven

More distant shrink the Waters to his rule

Assigned ἶ) - But, if nor he nor I have power

To move thee, let thy proper Heaven awake

Thy pity! Look around thee l Either pole ³40

Already smokes —let these but burst in flame,

And all thy palaoe topples l Atlas' sels,

Half stifled‚ searce the glowing globe sustains!

If Sea, and Laud, and Sky must perish thus,

Chaos again eonfounds us! Resoue yet :us

What rests, and in thy meroy help the World! ''
