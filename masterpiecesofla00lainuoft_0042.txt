14 TERENCE

Antipho. I know myself and my offence3 I leave
Phanium and my life in your hands. [Emit Izastc’ly.

Phaedria. What will happen nOW, Geta?

Geta. You ’ll get a lecture3 and I, unless I'm very
much mistaken, shall be tied up and flogged. But,
Phaedria, we ourselves must now carry out the advice
which we just gave to Antipho.

Phaedria. Away with your “ musts,''—give me
your orders.

Geta. Do you remember what you used to say at
the very beginning of this business, by way of shielcl-
ing us from blame,— that the case against us was law-
ful and clear, sure to win, as good as it could be?

Phaedria. I remember.

Geta. Well, there 's need of the selfsame defenee
now, or, if possible, of one better and more plausible.

Phaedria. I 'll do my best. Ι

Geta. Now do you attaek first. I 'll be here in re-
serve, ready to relieve you, if you fail.

Phaedria. Agreed. (They γετίνα to back· of staqe.)

ried without my consent! Had he no regal-d for my
authority? No, I’ll say nothing about my author-
ity, but for my displeasure? No shame? Oh, what
an outrage! Oh, that Geta, his prompterl

G eta (asido). My turn at last!

Demipho. What will they say to me? What ex-
cuse will they find?
