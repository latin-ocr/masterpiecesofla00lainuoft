More pleasing morsels would afford so

Thau the fat olives of my fields 3
Than shards or mallows for the pot,

Thai keep the loosen'd body sound,
Or than the lamb that falls by lot

To the just guardian 1 of my ground. 85
Amidst these feasts of happy swains,

The jolly shepherd smiles to see
His flook returning from the plains ;

The farmer is as pleas'd as he,
To view his oxen, sweating smoke‚ 9⁰
Bear on their necks the loosen’d yoke ε
To look upon his menial crew,

That sit around his oheerful hearth,
And bodies spent in toil renew

With wholesome food and country mirth.’' 95
This Morecraft 2 said within himself3

Resolv'd to leave the wicked town,

And live retir'd upon his own,

He call'd his money in;

But the prevailing love of pelf 100
Soon split him on the former shelf,

He put it out again.
