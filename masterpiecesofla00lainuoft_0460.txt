BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

ΤΗΕ paucity and meagreness of the traditions that have
come down to us about the life of Juvenal preclude the pos-
sibility of anything but an extremely flimsy reconstruction
of it. He lived during the last half of the first century of
our era and the first part of the second, various activities‚
if we are to believe the ancient accounts, filling up his long
life. He is said to have seen some military service, to
have held certain municipal offices in Aquinum in Latium,
presumably his native town, to have turned ιο the writing
of satire only after spending many years in the practice
of declamation, and finally in his eightieth year to have
been banished to Egypt, under the pretext of a military
command, as a penalty for having in one of his satires
reflected upon an actor who was a favorite at court.

He has left us sixteen satires‚ some of them on general
moral themes, but the majority satirizing conditions or ten-
dencies in society at Rome. In some cases he handles the
same topics as Martial, but instead of Martial's flippant
light-heartedness we find bitterness and indignation‚ ex-
pressed with a rush of rhetoric and a mordancy of phrase
that make them unique even in this kind of writing. His
sincerity has often been i1npeached3 but, while conceding
that many passages are mari-ed by exaggeration, and that
in the heat of declamation the feeling is not infrequently
forced, it seems probable that his work was for the most
part based on genuine convictions. However this may be,
there can be no question as to the brilliancy of his rhetoric,
