158 CICERO

he has begun to love3 and they are equal in love,
and on either side are more inclined to bestow obli-
gations than to claim a return, so that in this mat—
ter there is an honorable rivalry between them. Thus
will the greatest benefits be derived from friendship‚
and it will have a more solid and genuine founda-
tion as tracing its origin to nature than if it pro·
ceeded from human weakness. For if it were utility
that cernented friendships‚ an altered aspect of util-
ity would dissolve them. But because nature can-
not be changed, therefore true friendships are eternal.
This may suffice for the origin of friendship, unless
you have, perchance‚ some objection to what I have
said.
