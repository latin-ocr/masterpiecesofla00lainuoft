THE SACRJFICE OF IPHIGENIA 67

of things for our own son of the Memmii‚1 whom
thou, goddess, hast willed to have no peer, rich as he
ever is in every grace. VVherefore all the more, O lady,
lend my lays an ever living charm. Cause meanwhile
the savage works of war to be lulled to rest through-
out all scas and lands3 for thou alone canst bless
mankind with calm peace, seeing that Mavors 2 lord of
battle controls the savage works of war, Mavors who
often flings himself into thy lap quite vanquished by
the never-healing wound of love3 and then with up-
turned face and shapely neck thrown back feeds with
love his greedy sight gazing, goddess, open-montbed
on thee; and as backward he reclines, his breath
stays hanging on thy lips. While then, lady, heis
reposing on thy holy body, shed thyself about him
and above, and pour from thy lips sweet discourse,
asking, glorious dame, gentle peace for the Romans.
For neither can we in our country's day of trouble
with untroubled mind think only of our work, nor can
the illustrious offset of Memmius in times like these

be wanting to the general weal.
H. A. J. MUNRO.

Of dark Religion lowering from the skies ;
