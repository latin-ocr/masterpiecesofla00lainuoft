To MAECENAS 317

To Cynthia all my wishes I confine3

Or if, alas! it be my fate to try

Another love, the qnicker let me die ε το
Β111 5110, 1110 mistress of my faithful breast‚

Has oft the charms of constancy confessed,
Condemns her fickle sex's fond mistake‚

And hates the tale of Troy for Helen's sake.

Me from myself the soft enchantress stole ; 75
Ah 1 let her ever my desires control,

Or if I fall the victim of her scorn,

From her loved door may my pale corse be borne.
The power of herbs can other harms remove,

And find a cure for every ill but love. 80
The Malian’s ¹ hurt Machaon could repair,

Heal the slow chief, and send again to war 3

To Chiron2 Phoenix3 owed his long-lost sight,

And Phoebus’ son 4 recall’d Androgeos to the light.
Here arts are vain, e’en magic here must fail, 85
The powerful mixture and the mielnight spell;

The hand that can my captive heart release,

And to this bosom give its wonted peace,

May the long thirst of Tantalus 5 allay,

Or drive th' infernal vulture from his prey.6 90
