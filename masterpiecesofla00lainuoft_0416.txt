388 PETRONIUS

pense of sear or of hope. Yet he did not fling away life
with precipitato haste, but having made an incision in his ’
veins and theu, according to his humor, bound them up, he
again opened them, while he conversed with his friends,
not in a serious sti-ain or on topics that might win for him
-the glory of courage. And he listened to them as they
, repeated, not thoughts on the immortality of the soul or on
the theories of philosophem, but light poetry and. playful
verses. To some of his slaves he gave liberal presents, a
flogging to others. He dined, indulged himself in sleep,
that death, though forced on him, might have a natural
appearance. Even in his will he did not, as did many
others in their last moments, flatter Nero or Tigellinus or
any other of the men in power. On the contrary, he de-
scribed fully the prince’s shameful excesses, with the names
of his male and female companions‚ and their novelties in
debauchery, and sent the account under seal to Nero. Then
he broke his signet ring, that it might not be subsequently
available for imperilling others.’' ¹

Such is the sketch which Tacitus 2 gives of the man who
was in all probability the author of the Satio-ae, of which
unfortunately only fragments of the fifteenth and sixteenth
books remain. The work, which was for the most part in
prose, contained an account of the adventures of one Encol-
pius and his companions on a journey in southern Italy.
The interest which it has for us on the literary side as an
example of the Roman novel, and on the linguistic side
by reason of its contribution to our knowledge of colloquial
Latin, is still further enhanced by its drastic representa-
tions of current abuses and strikingly realistic pictures of
various aspects of the social life of the times.
