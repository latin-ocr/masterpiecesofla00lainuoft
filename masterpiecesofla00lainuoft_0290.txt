262 VIRGIL

Thence man’s race, and the beast, and the bird that
on pinions flies,

All wild shapes that are hidden the gleaming waters
beneath.

Eaeh elemental seed has a fiery force from the skies‚

Eaeh‚ its heavenly being, that no dull clay can dis-
guise,

Bodies of earth ne'er deaden, nor limbs long destined
to death. 740

Hence, their fears and desires3 their sorrows and
joys 3 for their sight,

Blind with the gloom of a prison, diseerns not the
heavenly light.

“ Nor when at last life leaves them, do all sad ills, that
belong

Unto the sinful body, depart 3 still many survive
Lingering within them, alas! for it needs must be
that the long 745*
Growth should in wondrous fashion at full eompletion
arrive.
So, due vengeanee racks them, for deeds of an earlier
day
Suffering pemmoe, and some to the winds hang view-
less and thin
Searehed by the breezes; from others, the deep in·
fection of sin
Swirling water washes, οι· bright fire purges, away. τω
Eaeh in his own sad ghost we endure3 then pass to
the wide
Realms of Elysium. Few in the fields of the happy
abide,
Till great Time, when the cycles have run their
⁰ courses on high,
