nothing else to look at, only see the objects which are
present before my mind. If Ι 113113 anything on hand,
I think it over, and weigh every word as carefully as
though I were actually writing or revising, and in this
way I get through more or less work, according as the
subject is easy or difficult to compose and bear in
mind. I call for a shorthand writer, and, after let-
ting in the daylight‚ Ι dictate the passages which Ι
have composed3 then he leaves me, and Ι send for him
again, and once again dismiss him.

At the fourth or fifth hour, according as the weather
tempts me, —for I have no fixed and settled plan for
the day, —I betake myself to my terrace 01· covered
portico, and there again Ι resume my thinking and
dictating. I ride in my carriage‚ and still continue
my mental occupation, just as when Ι 3111 walking or
lying down. My concentration of thought is unaf-
fected, or rather is refreshed by the change. Then Ι
snatch a brief sleep, and again walk, and afterwards
read aloud a Greek or Latin speech, as clearly and
distinctly as Ι can, not so much to exercise the vocal
organs as to help my digestim, though it does at the
same time strengthen my voice. I take another walk,
then Ι 3111 anointed‚ and take excrcise and a bath.
While Ι am at dinner, if Ι 3111 dining with my wife
or a few friends, 3 book is read to 115, and afterwards
we hear a comic actor or a musician3 then Ι walk
with my attendants, some of whom arc men of learn-
ing. Thus the evening is passed away with talk 011
311 sorts of subjects, and even the longest day is soon
done.

Sometimes Ι vary this routine‚ for, if Ι have been
lying down, or walking for any length of time, as soon
as I have had my sleep and read aloud‚ I ride 011
