40 TERENCE

0111 of smooth water 111110 a roek. What worse poliey
could there have been than 10 touch this sore, and
mention 1ny wife ζ) You 've given my father hopes of
being able 10 turn her 0111. Come now, if Phormio
gets this dowry, 116 ’ll have 10 marry her. What 's to
be done then?

Geta. But he won’t marry her.

Antipho. Oh, no! of course not! And when they
demand their money back, 011 my account, forsooth,
he ’ll prefer 1116 stoeks 1

Geta. There ’s no story, Antipho, that ean't be
spoiled in the telling. You leave out all the strong
points, and put in all the weak ones. Now hear
the other side. If he receives 1116 money, he 'll have
10 marry her, as you say, and I agree with you so
far. But at least some little time will be given for
getting ready the nuptials, for invitations, for sacrifie-
ing. Meanwhile, Phaedria’s friends wil] give him the
money that they have promised, and then Phormio
wil] pay it back again.

Antipho. On what) ground? What excuse-will he
make?

Geta. Do you ask? Why, he ’ll say, “So many
evil omens have befallen me since this business was
begun: a strange blaek dog came into my house3 a
snake fell from the tiles through the skylight3 a hen
erowed3 1116 soothsayer has forbidden it3 the divinet
has put a stop 10 ἱ1; 10 begin any new business before
winter ''—an excellent reason. That's how things
will go.

Antipho. I sineerely hope so.

Geta. They will3 trust me. Here ’s your father
coming 0111 of 1116 house. Be Off, and tell Phaedria
that we 've got 1116 money. [Emit ANTIPHO.
