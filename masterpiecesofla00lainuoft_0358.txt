330 OVID

This, when thou told'st me, struck my tender beart,
That such requital followed such desert.

Nor doubt Ι but the Gods, for crimes like these,
Seven winters ¹ kept thee wandel-ing on the seas, 90
Thy starved companions, cast ashore‚ Ι fed,

Thyself admitted to my crown and bed.

To harbor strangers, suocor the distressed

VVas kind enough 3 but, oh, too kind the rest!

Curst be the cave which first my ruin brought, 9⁵
there, from the storm, we common shelter sought ἔ
Α dreadful howling echoed round the place3

The mountain nymphs, thought Ι, my nuptia] grace.
I thought so then, but now too late I know

The furies yelled my funerals from below. 100
Ο chastity and violated fame,

Exact your dues to my dead husband’s 2 name!

By death redeem my reputation lost,

And to his arms restore my guilty ghost!

Close by my palace, in a gloomy grove, ms
Is raised a chapel to my murdered love ;

There, wreathed with boughs and wool‚his statue stands,
The pious monument of artful hands.

Last night, methought‚ he called me from the dome,
And thrice, with hollow voice, cried‚ “ Dido, come 1 '⁹
She comes3 thy wife thy lawful summons hears, 111
But comes more slowly, clogged with conscious fears.
Forgive the wrong Ι offered to thy bed 3

Strong were his charms, who my weak faith misled.
His goddess mother, and his aged sire³ 115
Borne on his back, did to my fall conspire.

¹ Seven years had passed since the fall of Troy.

2 Sychaeus, after whose murder by her brother Pygmalion, king of
Tyre, Dido had flod to Africa and founded Carthage.

3 Aeneas had told her how he saved his father Anchises on the

night of the sack of Troy.
