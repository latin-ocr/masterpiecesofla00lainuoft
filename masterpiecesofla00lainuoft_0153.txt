LOVE AND HA TE 125

’T is hard at once to fling a love away 5
That has been eherish’d with the saith of years.

'T is hard: but shrink not, flinoh not. Come what
Crusffzgery record of its joys and fears.

Ο ye great gods, if ye can pity feel,

If e'er to dying wreteh your aid was given, 10
See me in agony before you kneel,

To beg this plague from out my core be driven,

Which creeps in drowsy horror ‘chro' each vein,
Leaves me no thought from bitter anguish free3

I do no't ask that she be kind again, 15
Nor pure: for that can never, never be.

I only orave the healssh that once was mine,
Some little respite from this sore disease.
If e’er I earned your meroy, powers divine,
Grani: me— Ο grant to a siok heart some ease! 20

Sm THEODORE Mmmm.

LOVE AND HATE
(LXXXV.)

I LOVE and hate. Ah! never ask why so!
I hate and love —and that is all l know.

I see ’t is folly, but I feel ’t is woe.
W. S. LANDOR.
