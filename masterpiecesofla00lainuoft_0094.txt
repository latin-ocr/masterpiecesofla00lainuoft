66 L UCRETJUS

INVOCATION TO VENUS¹
(1.‚1-43.)

MOTHER of the Aeneadae,² darling of men and
gods, increase-giving Venus, who beneath the gliding
signs of heaven fillest with thy presence the ship-car-
rying sea, the corn-bearing lands, since through thee
every kind of living things is conceived, rises up and
beholds the light of the sun. Before thee, goddess,
flee the winds, the clouds of heaven3 before thee and
thy advent3 for thee earth manifold in works puts .
forth sweet-smelling flowers3 for thee the levels of the
sea do laugh and heaven propitiated shines with out-
spread light. For soon as the vernal aspect of day is
disclosed, and the birth favoring breath of favonius3
unbarred is blowing fresh, first the fowls of the air, O
lady, shew signs of thee and thy entering in, throughly
smitten in heart by thy power. Next the wild herds
bound over the glad pastures and swim the rapid
rivers: in such wise each made prisoner by thy charm
follows thee with desire, whither thou goest to lead
it on. Yes, throughout seas and mountains and
sweeping rivers and leafy homes of birds and grassy
plainS, striking fond love into the breasts of all thou
constrainest them each after its kind to continue their
races with desire. Since thou then art sole mistress
of the nature of things, and without thee nothing rises
up into the divine borders of light, nothing grows to
be glad or lovely, I would have thee for a helpmate in
writing the verses which I essay to pen on the nature
