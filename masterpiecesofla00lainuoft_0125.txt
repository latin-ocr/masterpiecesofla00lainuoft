THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN 97

the hollows of reeds first taught peasants to blow into
hollow stalks. Then step by step they learned sweet
plaintive ditties, which the pipe pours forth pressed by
the fingers of the players, heard through pathless woods
and forests and lawns, through the unfreqnented haunts
