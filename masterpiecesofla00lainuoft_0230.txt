202 VIRGIL

Take these strains at thy bidciing essayed, and grant:

me ‘co la
Round thy broi} these ivies to twine with the oon-
queror's bay. 15

Hardly as yet from the skies had the night’s ohill
shadow dispemed,

Dew lay sweet on the spring-tide grass for the cattle
athirst ;

Propped on an olive staff thus sang young Damon,
the first:

(Damon sinys.)

Rise, fair star of the morning, and herald ‘che genial
day.

I, whom a passion for Nysa the false has served. to
betmy, 20

Here will lament3 and to gods—whose presence
attested in vain

Naught has availed me—in death’s last hour once
more will complain.

Begin, my flute of the mountains‚ with me my Mae-
nalus 1 strain.

Maenalus ever has forests that sing to him3 ever a

Speakssilffliiis pines 3 to the loves of the shepherds he
listens for aye3 2⁵

Hears Pau piping‚ who brooked not that reeds should
idle remain.

Regin, my flute of the mountains‚ with me my Mae—
nalus strain.

h ² Mt. Maenalus in Arcadia was a haunt of Pan, the god of shep-
erds.
