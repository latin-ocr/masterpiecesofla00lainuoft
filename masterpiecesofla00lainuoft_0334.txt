306 TIB ULL US

With glittering spoils, Messala) gild thy dome,

Be thine the noble task to lead the brave ; w
A lovely foe me captive holds at home,

Chain'd to her scornful gate, a watchful slave.

Inglorious post 1 — and yet I heed not fame ε
Th' applause of erowds for Delia Ι ’d resign ε

To live with thee I 'd bear the ooward’s name, 75
Nor ’midst the scorn of nations once repine.

With thee to live Ι 'd mock the ploughman's toil,
Or on some lonely mountain tend my sheep3

At night I 'd lay me on the flinty soil,
And happy ’midst thy dear embraees sleep. 80

What drooping lover heeds the Tyrian 2 bed,
While the long night is pass'd with many a sigh3
Nor softest down with richest carpets spread,
Nor whisp'ring rills can close the weeping eye.

Of threefold iron were his rugged frame, 8⁵
Who, when he might thy yielding heart obtain,
Could yet attend the calls of empty fame,
Or follow arms in quest of sordid gain.

Unenvied let him drive the vanquished host,
Through captive lands his conquerin g armies lead ;

Unenvied wear the robe with gold emboss’d, 91
And guide with solemn state his foaming steed.

Oh may I view thee with life’s parting ray,
And thy dear hand with dying ardor press :

¹ His patron, who was iu Asia. Tibullus had been indueed to
accompany him, but falling ill at Corcyra had returned to Rome.
² Luxurious as those of the people of Tyro.
