180 CICERO

TO GAIUS TREBONIUS, IN ASIA¹
(Fam. X„ 28.)

Rorm, Β. c. 43.

How I could wish that you had invited me to that
most glorious banquet on the Ides of March! 2 We
should have had no leavings 1 3 While, as it is, we are
having such a trouble with them, that the magnificent
service which you men then did the state leaves room
for some grumbling. In fact, for Antony's having
been taken out of the way by you, —— the best of men,
— and that it was by your kindness that this pest still
survives‚ I sometimes do feel, though perhaps I have
110 right to do so, a little angry with you. For you
have left behind an amount of trouble which is greater
for me than for every one else put together.

For as soon as a meeting of the senate could be
freely held, after Antony's very undignified departure,
I returned to that old courage of mine, which along
with that gallant citizen, your father, you ever had
upon your lips and in your heart. For the tribunes
having summoned the senate for the 20th of Decem-
ber, and having brought a different piece of business
before it, I reviewed the situation as a whole‚4 and
spoke with the greatest fire, and tried all I could to
recall the now languid and wearied senate to its an-
cient and traditional valor, more by an exhibition of
high spirit than of eloquence.

1 Trebonius had taken a prominent part in the conspiracy which
resulted in the assassination of Caesar. He afterwards went as pro-
consul to the province of Asia.

² The date of the assassinqtion.

3 Cicero would have had Antony killed too.
4 The speech alluded to is the third Philippie.
