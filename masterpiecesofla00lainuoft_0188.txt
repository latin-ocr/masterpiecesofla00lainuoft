TO HIS WIFE AND FAMILY IN ROME1
(Fam. XIV„ 2.)

THESSALONICA‚ B. c. 58.

Ι SEND this, my dear Terentia, with much love to
you, and my little Tullia, and my Marcus.

Ι hope you will never think that I write longer let-
ters to other people, unless it so happens that any one
has written to me about a number of matters that seem
to require an answer. In fact, I have nothing to say,
nor is there anything just now that I find more diffi-
eult. But to you and my dear little girl Ι cannot
write without shedding many tears, when I picture to
myself‚ as plunged in the deepest afflietion‚ you whom
my dearest wish has been to see perfeetly happy 3 and
this I ought to have seoured for you 3 yes, and I would
have seeured, but for our being all so faint-hearted.

I am most grateful to our friend Piso 2 for his kind
services, I did my best to urge that he would not forget
you when I was writing to him 3 and have now thanked
him as in duty bound. I gather that you think there
is hope of the new tribunes 3 that will be a safe thing
to depend on, if we may on the profession of Pompe-
ius, but I have my fears of Crassus. It is true I see
that everything on your part is done both bravely and
lovingly, nor does that surprise me, but what pains
me is that it should be my fate to expose you to such
severe suffering to relieve my own. For Publius Vale·

1 Written during his exile. 2 Tullia's husband.
