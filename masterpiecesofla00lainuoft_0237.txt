RULES OF HUSBANDRY 209

And this among the first: Your threshing—floor

With ponderous roller must be levelled smooth, 5
And wrought by hand, and fixed with binding chalk,
Lest weeds arise, or dust a passage win

Splitting the surfaoe‚ then a thousand plagues

Make sport of it ε oft builds the tiny mouse

Her home, and plants her granary‚ underground‚ 10
Or burrow for their bed the purblind moles,

Or toad is found in hoflows, and all the swarm

Of earth's unsightly creatures 3 or a huge

Corn-heap the weevil plunders‚ and the ant,

F earful of coming age and penury. 15
Mark too, what time the walnut in the woods

With ample bloom shall olothe her, and bow down
Her odorous branohes: if the fruit prevail,

Like store of grain will follow, and there shall come
A mighty winnowing-time with mighty heat 3 20
But if the shade with wealth of leaves almund,
Vainly your threshing-floor will bruise the stalks
Swoln but with ohaff. Many myself have seen
Steep, as they sow, their pulse-seeds, drenohing them
With lees of oil and natron, that the fruit 25
Might swell within the treacherous pods, and they
Make speed to boil at howso’ small a fire.

Yet, culled with oaution, proved with patient toil‚
These have I seen degenerate, did not man

Put forth his hand with power, and year by year 30
Choose out the largest. So, by fate impelled,

Speed all things to the worse, and backward borne
Glide from us 3 even as who with struggling oars

Up stream soarce pulls a shallop‚ if his arms

Relax but for one moment, and the boat

Is headlong swept adown the hurrying tide.

JAMES RnoAnEs.
