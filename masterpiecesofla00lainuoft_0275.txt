AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 247

But the Achaean ¹ chiefs‚ Agamemnon’s2 legions ar-
r ν

When ozyfflssle hero bhey looked, and his armor gleam-
ing in shade,

Shook with an infinite terror, and some turned from
him and fied,

As to the Danaan ¹ vessels in days gone by they had

Some ozpffle air raise thinnest of voices 3 the shout ἒξ
the fray

Seems, upon lips wide-parted‚ begun‚ then passing
away.

Noble Deiphobus here he beholds, all mangled and
mam-ed,

Son of the royal Priam 3—his visage oruelly scam-ed,

Visage and hands 3 from his ravaged temples bloodily
shorn 500

Eaeh of his ears, and his nostrils with wounds in-
glorious torn.

Hardly he knew him in sooth‚ for he trembled‚ seek-
ing to hide

These great wrongs ς but at last in a voice most lov-
ing he cried ε

“ Gallant Deiphobus, born of the Teucrian lineage
bright,

Who had the heart to revenge him in this dire fashion
and dread ? 505

Who dated thus to abuse thee? On Troy's last
funeral night,

Weary of endless slaughter and Danaan blood, it was
said

¹ Greek. 2 The leader of the Greeks.
