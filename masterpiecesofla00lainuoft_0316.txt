288 HORA GE

Is sprouting all for love and victory 5
In vain: his warm red blood, so easily stirred,
Thy gelid stream shall dye,
Child of the wanton herd.

Thee the fieroe Sirian star,1 to madness fired‚ 9
Forbears to touch: sweet eool thy waters yield‚
To ox with ploughing tired,
And lazy sheep aefield.

Thou, too, one day shalt win proud eminenoe
'Mid honored founts, while Ι the ilex sing
Crowning the eavern whence 15

Thy babbling wavelets spring.
Jonn Goumaron.

TO MAECENAS
(oses, 111„ 29.)

MAECENAS, thou whose lineage springs

From old Etruria’s Kings,

Come to my humble dwelling.² Haste3
A eask unbroaohed of mellow wine

Awaits thee, roses interlaced, ⁵
And perfumes pressed from nard divine.

Leave Tibur 3 sparkling with its hundred rills;
Forget the sunny slopes of. Aesulae‚4

And rugged peaks of Telegonian hills5
That frown defiance on the Tusoan sea. ιο

¹ The dog-star. 2 His Sabine villa.

³ The modern Tivoli‚ about sixteen miles northeast of Rome.

4 Properly Aesula‚ a Latin town between Tibur and Praeneste.

⁵ It was on a ridge of these mountains that Tusculum, said to have

been founded by Telegonus, son of Ulysses‚ was situated‚ about ten
miles southeast of Rome.
