how this kinsman of his neglected him. But what a
man he was! the best I ’ve ever known.

Phormio. Oh, go and be hanged! If I had n’t
thought so highly of him, I never should have got
into all this trouble with your family for the daugh-

Geta. You scoundrel, are you going to continue
abusing my master behind his back?

Phormio. But he deserves it.

Geta. This fellow has never ceased to heap abuse
on you behind your back, saying things which don't
apply to you at all, but to himself.

explain to me who that friend of yours was, and how
he claimed kinship with me.

Phormio. Fishing‚ just as if you did n't know
him l

Demipho. I know him?

Phormio. Yes.

Demipho. I tell you that I don't know him ; recall
him to my memory, since you say Ι do.

Demipho. You ’ll be the death of me. Tell me his

name.
