THE POET’S IDEAL 307

Sure thou wilt weep — and on thy lover's clay, 95
With breaking heart, print many a tender kiss!

Sure thou wilt weep —— and woes unutter’d feel,
When on the pile thou seest thy lover laid 1

For well I know, nor flint, nor ruthless steel
Can arm the breast of such a gentle maid. 100

From the sad pomp, what youth, what pitying fair,
Returning slow‚ can tender tears refrain‘?

O Delia, spare thy cheeks, thy tresses spare,
Nor give my ling’ring shade a world of pain.

But now while smiling hours the Fates bestovv, 105
Let love, dear maid, our gentle hearts unite!

Soon death will come and strike the fatal blow 3
Unseen his head, and veil'd in shades of night.

Soon oreeping age will bow the lover's frame,

And tear the myrtle chaplet from his brow : 110
With hoary looks ill suits the youthful flame,

The soft persuasion‚ or the ardent VOW.

Now the fair queen of gay desire is ours,
And lends our follies an indulgent smile:

’T is lavish youth’s t' enjoy the frolie hours, 115
The wauton revel and the midnight broil.

Your chief, my friends and fellow-soldiers‚ I
To these light wars will lead you boldly on:

Far hence, ye trumpets, sound, and banners fly ;
To those who eovet wounds and fame begoue. 120

And bear them fame and wounds3 and riches beai-3
There are that fame and wounds and riehes prize.
