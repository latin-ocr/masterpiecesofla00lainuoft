PHAETHON

(Metamorphoses H.‚ 1-366.)

SUBLIME on lofty columns, bright with gold
And fiery carbuncle, its roof inlaid
With ivory‚ rose the Palaee of the Sun,
Approaohed by folding gates with silver sheen
Radiant3 material prioeless‚ —- yet less prized 5
For 115 own worth than what 1116 cunning hand
Of Μι116111611 thereon had wrough‘c, —— the globe
Of Earth, — 1116 Seas that wash it round, — the Skies
That overhang 11. ’Mid 1116 waters played
Their Gods caerulean. Triton 2 with his horn 10
Was there, and Proteus 3 of 1116 shifting shape,
And old Aegeon‚4 curbing with firm hand
The monsters of the deep. Her Nereids there
Round Doris 5 sported, seeming‚ some 1ο swim,
Some on 1116 rocks their tresses green 1ο dry, 15
Some dolphin-borne to ride3 nor all in face
The same, nor different ς - so should sisters be.
Earth showed her men, and towns, and woods, and

beasts,

And streams, and. Nymphs, and rural Deities z
And over all 1116 111111116 Heaven was bright 20
With 1116 twelve Zocliac signs, on either valve
Of the great portal figured, —— six on each.

² Vulean in his funetion as a smith.
