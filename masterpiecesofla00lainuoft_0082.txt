54 TERENCE

hold of Phormio as soon as possible, and get our thirty
minae away from him before he squanders them.

Phormio (comianorward). Ι should like to see
Demipho, if he 's at home, to—

Demipho. Why, we were just going to you,
Phormio.

Phormio. For the same reason, perhaps?

Demipho. Yes.

Phormio. That ’s what Ι thought. And why were
you coming to me?

Demipho. Such a question!

Phormio. Did you think that I would n't do what I
had once undertaken? Now, mark you, Ι may be poor,
but I 've always made a point of preserving my honor.
So Ι ’ve come to you, Demipho, to say that I ’m ready.
Give me my wife as soon as you please‚ for on seeing
how you had set your hearts on this Ι deferred all
other business, as it was right Ι should.

Demipho. But my brother here has counselled me
not to give her to you. ‘⁶ Think,” he says, ‘⁶ what a
scandal it will make, if you <103 she was n’t given be-
fore, when it might have been done honorably‚ and
it 's a shame to drive her out of doors now as a
divorced woman.'' He used pretty nearly the same
arguments as you did to me a little while ago.

Phormio. You ’re treating me pretty cavalierly.

Demipho. How so?

Phormio. Do you ask ⁶? Because Ι shan’t be able
to -marry the other girl either, for how could I have
the face to go back to her whom I jilted?

Chremes (asida to DEMIPHO). Say, ‘⁶ Besides, Ι
see that Antipho does n’t want to part with her.''

Demipho. Besides, I see that my son does n’t want
to part with his wife. But, Phormio, pray come to
the bank, and have that money paid back to me.
