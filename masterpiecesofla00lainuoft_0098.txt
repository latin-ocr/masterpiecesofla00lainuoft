70 LUCRETIUS

empty and void space. Therefore sure enough body
and void are marked off in alternate layers, since the
universe is neither of a perfect fulness nor a perfect
void. There are, therefore certain bodies which can
vary void space with full. These can neither be
broken in pieces by the stroke of blows from without,
nor have their texture undone by aught piercing to
their core nor give way before any other kind of
assault3 as we have proved to you a little before.
For without void nothing seems to admit of being
crushed in or broken up or split in two by cutting, or
of taking in wet or permeating cold or penetrating
fire, by which all things are destroyed. And the
more anything contains within it of void, the more
thoroughly it gives way to the assault of these things.
Therefore if first bodies are as I have shown solid and
without void, they must be everlasting. Again unless
matter had been eternal, all things before this would
have utterly returned to nothing and whatever things
we see would have been born anew from nothing. But
since I have proved above that nothing can be produced
from nothing, and that what is begotten cannot be
recalled to nothing, first beginnings must be of an im-
perishable body, into which all things can be dissolved
at their last hour, that there may be a supply of mat·
ter for the reproduction of things. Therefore first·
beginnings are of solid singleness, and in no other way
can they have been preserved through ages during

infinite time past in order to reproduce things.
