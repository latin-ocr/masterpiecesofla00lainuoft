Ye knew it then, and all its raee,
And know the pinnace too, ⁴20
Which from its earliest 1·ise‚ to grace
Thy lofty summit grew3
And in the waves that wash thy shores
Which moisten’d first its sturdy oars.

Thence many vainly raging seas 25
It bore its master through 3

Whether from right οι· left the breeze
Upon the canvas blew ;

Or prosperous to its course the gale

Spread full and square the straining sail. 30

No vows to Ocean's gods it gave,
For then no storm could shake 3
WVhen erst from that remotest wave
It sought this limpid lake : ¹
But, ah! those days are fied at length, 3⁵
And fied with them are speed and strength.

Now old, worn out, and lost to fame,

In rest that 's justly due,
It dedicates this shatter’d frame,

Ye glorious Twins,2 to you — ιο
To you, whose often cheering ray

Beam'd light and safety on its way.
Gnonon LAMB.
