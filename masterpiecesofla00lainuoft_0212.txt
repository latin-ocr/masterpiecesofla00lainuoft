184 CAESAR

It is perhaps the clement of restraint and reserve that
contributes most to the effectiveness of Caesar's style. His
narrative, moreover, is marked by a sustained objectivity:
he writes as if he had been only a spectator of the events of
which he was so great a part. Carefully avoiding all merely
rhetorical devices, and using only the purest Latin, he tells
his story with the utmost directness, simplicity‚ and clearness.

THE SIEGE OF ALESIA¹

Taken from the narrative based on De Bello Gallico, VII„ 69-89, in
T. Rice Holmes' Caesar's Conquest of Gaul.

NEXT day the Romans arrived at Alesia, where
Vercingetorix was preparing to make his final stand.
The column descended a valley closed on the right and
the left by the hills of Bussy and Pevenel. On their
left front, connected with Pevenel by a broad neck of
land, rose a hill, much lower than Gergovia‚2 but
still too steep to be taken by assault. The Gauls
were swarming on the eastern slope, beneath the
scarped rocks of the plateau, on which stood the town 3
and Vercingetorix had made them build a wall and
dig a ditch to protect their encampment. Just at
their feet the legions saw a stream, the Oze, winding
like a steely thread through the greenery that fringed
the north of the hill3 and beyond its southern side,

¹ Alesia, the capital of the Mandubii, now Aliso Ste. Reine on Mont
Auxois, west of Dijon, was the scene of the last concerted attempt on
the part of the Gauls to free themselves from Roman rule. That this
rebellion of 52 Β. 0., which had begun in the country of the Arverni,
the modern Auvergne, became a national one was due very largely to
the enthusiastic patriotism and personal magnetism of the young
Arvernian chieftain Vercingetorix. It was only after many months
of fighting that Caesar forced the rebels to retreat to Alesia.

² The capital of the Arverni, upon which Caesar had made an unsuc-
cessful attack.
