THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN 99

eonsign the deeds of men to verse3 and letters had not
been invented long before. For this reason our age
cannot look back to what has gone before, save where
reason points out any traces.

Ships and tillage, walls, laws, roads, dress, and all
such like things, all the prizes, all the eleganoies too of
life without exception, poe1nsâ€špietures, and the chisel-
ling of fine-wrought statues, all these things practice
together with the aequired knowledge of the until-ing
mind taught men by slow degrees as they advaneed on
the way step by step. Thus time by degrees brings
each several thing forth before men's eyes and reason
raises it up into the bomlers of light 3 for things must
be brought to light one after the other and in due
order in the different arts, until these have reached

their highest point of development.
