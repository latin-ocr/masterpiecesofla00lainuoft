ROME 435

And still makes less the little of to-day3 40
I go, where Daedalus, as poets sing,
First checked his ssight, and closed his weary wing:
While something yet of health and strength remains,
And yet no staff my faltering step sustains ς
While few gray hairs upon my head are seen, 45
And my old age is vigorous still, and green.
Here, then, I bid my much—beloved home farewell —
Ah, mine no more ἶ - there let Arturius 1 dwell,
And Catulus,1 knaves, who in truth's despite
Can white to black transform, and black to white, 50
Build temples, furnish funerals‚ auctions hold,
Farm rivers, ports, and scour the drains for gold 1
Once they were trumpeters‚ and always found
With strolling fencers in their annual round,
While their puffed cheeks, which every village knew, 55
Called to ‘⁶ high feats of arms '' the rustic crew:
Now they give shows 2 themselves; and, at the will
Of the base rabble, raise the sign 3 — to kill,
Ambitious of their voice ε then turn once more
To their vile gains, and farm the common shore! ἐυ
And why not everything?——- since Fortune throws
Her more peculiar smiles on such as those,
Whene'er, to wanton merriment inclined,
She lifts to thrones the dregs of human kind 1
But why, my friend, should I at Rome remain? 65
I cannot teach my stubborn lips to feign ;
Nor, when I hear a great man’s verses, smile,
And beg a copy, if I think them vile.
A sublunary wight, I have no skill

¹ Any swindlers. ‘⁸' Gladiatorial shows.

3 To turn up the thumb was the sig—nal that a fallen gladiator
should be despatched. It was properly done by the spectators‚ not
by the givet of the games.
