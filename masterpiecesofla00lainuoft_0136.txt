CA TULL US

VARUS' MISTRESS
(Χ)

VARUS, whom Ι chanced to meet

The other evening in the street,

Engaged me there, upon the spot,

To see a mistress he had got.

She seem'd, as far as I can gather‚ 5
Lively and smart, and handsome rather.

There, as we rested from our walls,

We enter’d into different talk —

As, how much might Bithynia bring?

And had I found it a good thing? 10
I answer’d, as it was the fact,

The province had been stript ancl sack'd 3

That there was nothing for the praetors,

And still less for us wretched creatures,

His poor companions and toad-eaters. 15

“ At least,'’ says she, “ you bought some fellows

To bear your litter 3 for they tell us,
Our only good ones come from there.'’
I chose to give myself an air 3

‘⁶ Why, truly, with my poor estate, 20

The difference was n't quite so great

Betwixt a province, good or bad,

That where a purchase could be had,

Eight lusty fellows‚ straight and tall,

I should n't find the wherewithal 25
To buy them.” But it was a lie3

For not a single wretch had I —

No single cripple fit to bear

A broken bedstead or a chair.

She, like a strumpet, pert and knowing, 30
