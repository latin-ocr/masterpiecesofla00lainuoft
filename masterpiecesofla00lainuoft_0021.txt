INTRODUC'TION xi

grammarians, who, zealous and acute, albeit sometimes
misguided, exorcised the spirits of many a problem
of tense and mood, of long and short, —— ghosts that
have even to this day wandered restlessly over the
world, refusing to be laid, although more than the
traditional three handfuls of dust have been thrown
upon their remains.

The satirica] vein was steadily productive‚ appear-
ing either deliberately‚ of set purpose and intent, in
writings aimed at various abuseS, or incidentally in
works of heavier calibre. It is represented, as we
have seen, in such remnants as we have of the early
literature. It found exuberant vent in the comedies
of Plautus, and in a modified form enlivened the plays
of Terence. In Lucilius it attained to full and free
expression, and his fearlessness and vigor of attack,
his keenness of vision and rapidity of execution became
proverbial. Unfortunately he is not known to us ex-
cept in fragments of his works and through the refer-
ences of other writers, but we have enough to see that
he was singularly virile of mind and facile of pen.
As trenchant as he was merciless, he shewed in his
attacks on vice in high places a range of conception
that does not remind us of a literature in the making.
His technique was rude, as Augustan critics noted,
but its rudeness or crudeness served in many cases to
point the asperity of his invective.

Nor is satire wanting in the best of the later repub-
lican literature. It gave a Lucilian edge to more
than one poem of Catullu-SL made the dicta of Caesar
famous, was'the salt of Cicero's orations, in urbane
guise one of the charms of his letters.

 

Emergent still under the' Empire it manifested
within ffPJEEQ'RQWU work a striking development.
