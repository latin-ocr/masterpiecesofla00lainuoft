THE SPEECH FOR CLUENTIUS 143

511011 11 monster 01 iniquity, where to such a hateful
and horrible abomination as having ever had its birth?
Surely you see now, gentlemen‚ that it was only under
constraint of the weightiest reasons that Ι spoke as I
did of a mother at the beginning of my speech. Yes,
there is no form 01 evil 01· 01 0111110 111111 5110 11115 1101
from the first desired‚ longed for, contrived, and put into
execution against her 5011. Ι say nothing of her first
outrageous lust, I say nothing 01 her accursed union
with her son-in-law‚ I say nothing of how a mother's
passion drove a daughter from her husband's ar1ns3 all
this, though it brought dishonor 011 1110 whole family, did
not go 50 far as to put my client in danger of his life.
I do not arraign her second marriage with Oppianicus,
by contracting which — but not till he had given her
his children’s lives in pledge ¹ -— she plunged a family
in mourning for the death 01 111050 who should have
been her step-sons. I pass by the fact that, though she
knew that it was Oppianicus who had procured the
proscription and assassination 01 A. Aurius, whose
mother—in-law once and whose wife she herself but a
short time before had been, she chose for herself a
habitation and a home in which the tokens 01 1101 11115-
band’s death and his despoiled estate would day by
day be present to 1101 eyes. My first charge relates to
the crimina] attempt at poisoning by Ε1ι11110115,2 which
has now at length been brought to light. What was
even at that early date matter of 'suspicion to men in
general, and of incredulity to my client, now appears
evident and obvious to all z the mother cannot 01 0011150
1111νο been kept in ignorance of that attempt. Oppi-

1 Oppianicus was charged with having removed his widower’s en-
cumbrance on Sassia's request.
2 Oppianicus’ agent in the attempt on Cluentius' life.
