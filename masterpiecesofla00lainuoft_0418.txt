390 PETR ONIUS

An excellent funeral it was, — superior bier and trap—
pings, and the mour-ners first class.'' He was becom-
ing a bore, and Phileros interrupted him with, “ Oh,
let us leave the dead alone. He 's all right. He had
a decent life and a decent death. What has he to
complain of ἶ) Η6 rose from the gutter, and was once
so poor that 116 would have picked a farthing out of a
midden with his teeth. But he grew like a honey-
comb. I suppose he has left behind him a cool 100,-
000, and all in hard cash. To speak the truth —for,
as you know, I wear my heart upon my sleeve—he
was a rough—spoken fellow, quarrelsomeness personi-
fied. Now his brother was a fine, friendly, open-
handed gentleman, and kept a good table. At first
everythiug went ugly with him, but his first vine-crop
pulled him together3 he sold his wine for whatever he
chose to ask. But what really kept his head above
water was that legacy, when he walked into a good
deal more than was left him. That was why that
bloekhead Chrysanthus quarrelled with his own brother,
and left away his money to some Tom, Dick, or Harry.
It ’s an ill turn when a man turns his back on his own.
He took all his slaves told him for gospel, and they
played the deuce with him. Credulity is fatal, espe-
cially fer a business man. However, he got far more
than he deserved 3 Fortune's favorite, lead turned to
gold under his hands. And how many years do you
think he had on his back? Seventy and more, I
should say. But he was as hard as nails, and carried
his age splendidly‚ — as black as a crow. Ah, I knew
him long, long ago, when 116 did something smack,
something grow to. Ile had a general kind of taste.
Well, he enjoyed himself, and I for one don't blame
him. It ’s all he takes to the grave with him.”
