318 PROPERTIUS

For ills unseen what: remedy is found?
Or who ean probe the undiscover'd wound ?
The bed avails not, nor the leeoh’s care,
Nor changing skies ean hurt, nor sultry air.
’T is hard ‘ch’ elusive symptoms to explore3 95
To-day the lover walks, to-morrow is no more 3
A train of mourning friends attend his pall,
And wonder at the sudden funeral.
then then my fates that breath they gave shall
claim,
And the short marble but preserve a name, 100
A little verse my all that shall remain,
Thy passing courser’s slaoken’d speed restrain,
(Thou envied honor of thy poet’s days,
Of all our youth th' ambition and the praise 1)
Then to my quiet urn awhile draw near, 105
And say, while o’er the place you drop a tear,
‘⁶ Love and the fair were of his life the pride3
He lived, while she was kind3 and when she frown'd,

he died.'’

A CHANGE OF VIEW
(111.‚ 5, 19 seq.)

LONG as of youth the joyous hours remain,

Me may Castalia’s 1 sweet reoess detain,

Fast by ‘nh' umbrageous vale lull'd to repose,

W here Aganippe2 warbles as it flows 3

Or roused by sprightly sounds from ,out the trance, 5
I ’d in the ring knit hands, and join the Muses’ danee.

¹ A spring on Mt. Parnassus sacred to Apollo and the Muses.
2 A spring on Mt. Helicon in Boeotia.
