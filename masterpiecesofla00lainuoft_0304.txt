276 HORA ΟΕ

ΤΟ LYDIA
(Odes, 1.‚ 8.)

WVHY, Lydia, why,
I pray, by all the gods above,

Art so resolved that Sybaris should die,
And all for love?

Why doth he shun -5
The Campus Martius' ¹ sultry glare?

He that once reoked. of neither dust nor sun,
Why rides he there,

F irst of the brave‚
Tamiug the Gallio steed no more? 10
Why doth he shrink from Tiber’s yerw wave‘?
Why thus abhor

The wrestler's oil,
As ’t were from viper’s tongue distilled?

Why do his arms no livid bruises soil, 15
He, once so skilled,

The disc or dart
Far, far beyond the mark to hurl,

And tell me, tell me, in what nook apart‚
Like baby-girl‚ 20

Lurks the poor boy,
Veiling his manhood‚ as did Thetis' son,2
To 'scape war's bloody clang‚ while fated Troy

VVas yet undone ?
Sm Tmzonom: MARTm.

¹ The plain by the Tiber, where the Roman youth exereised.
'2 Achilles, who was disgu‘ssed as a girl by his mother to prevent
his being taken to the Trojan war.
