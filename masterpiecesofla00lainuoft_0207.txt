LETTERS 179

everything to obeying my father's injunctions, for
he had written ordering me to give him up at once.
I would n’t shilly-shally about the business, for fear
my making a fuss should cause my father to harbor
some suspicion. Moreover‚ it occurred to me that it
would be offensive for me to express an opinion on a
decision of my father’s. However, your interest and
advice are welcome and acceptable. Your apology for
lack of time I quite accept, for I know how busy you
always are. Ι am very glad that you have bought
an estate, and you have my best wishes for the success
of your purchase. Don't be surprised at my congrat-
ulations coming in at this point in my letter, for it was
at the corresponding point in yours that you told me
of your purchase. You are a man of property! You
must drop your city manners: you have become a
Roman country gentleman. How clearly Ι have your
dearest face before my eyes at this moment! For I
seem to see you buying things for the farm, talking
to your bailiff‚ saving the sceds at dessert in the
corner of your cloak. But as to the matter of money,
I am as sorry as you that Ι was not on the spot to
help you. But do not doubt, my dear Tiro, of my
assisting you in the future, if fortune does but stand
by me 3 especially as I know that this estate .has been
purchased for our joint advantage. As to my com-
missions about which you are taking trouble — many
thanksl But I beg you to send me a secretary at
the earliest opportunity—if possible a Greek3 for
he will save me a great deal of trouble in copying
out notes. Above all, take care of your health, that
we may have some literary talk together hereafter.
I commend Anteros ¹ to you.

¹ The slave who brought the letter.
