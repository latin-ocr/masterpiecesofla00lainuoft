398 MARTJAL

Though the rapid southern gales
Strive 130 rend theatric veils.¹
Still secure, the careless boy
Flings from limb to limb the toy ;
And the artist well may brave
All the force of wind and wave.
Little, dextrous Agathine

To eschew should'st thou incline,
Poor thy chance, alone of this:
Who still hits cau never miss.
Thou must change thy posturcs all;
Else the target ne'er will fall.

J Amas ELPHINSTON.

DEATH OF A CHARIOTEER
(Epigrams, X„ 50.)

LET Victory‚ sorrowing‚ cast her palm away,
Let Favor beat her breast and wail the day,
Let Honor don the mourner's dark attire,
And Glory fling her wreath upon the pyrc.
Snatched in his prime, Scorpus, sad thought! must go
To yoke night's horses in the realm below.
Swift flcw the chari0t‚ soon the goal was won‚
Another racc thou hast too quickly run.
GOanm Smrrn.
