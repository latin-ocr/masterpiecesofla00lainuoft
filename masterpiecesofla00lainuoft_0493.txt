sold there, for it is gratifying to find that they re·
tain in foreign parts the popularity they have won at
Rome. I begin to think that they must be fairly
good when there is such unanimity about their merits
in lands so far apart and in the judgment of persons
so dissimilar. Farewell.

TO MAXIMUS
(rx, 23.)

WHEN I have been pleading, it has often happened
that the Centumviri‚1 after strictly preserving for a
long time their judicia] dignity and gravity, have sud-
denly leaped to their feet en masse and applauded me,
as if they could not help themselves but were obliged
to do so. Ι have often again left the Senate-house with
just as much glory as Ι had hoped to obtain, but
Ι never felt greater gratification than Ι did a little
while ago at something which Cornelius Tacitus told
me in conversation. He said that he was sitting by
the side of a certain individual at the last Circen-
sian games, and that, after they had had a long and
learned talk on a variety of subjects, his acquaintance
said to him: ‘⁶ Are you from Italy or the provinces ‘? '’
Tacitus replied ; “ You know me quite well, and that
from the books of mine you have read.‘’ “Then‚”
said the man, “you are either Tacitus or Pliny.” I
cannot express to you how pleased I am that our
names are, so to speak‚ the property of literature, that
they are literary titles rather than the names of two
men, and that both of us are familiar by our writings
to persons who would otherwise know nothing of us.
