as sure a pledge of good saith as of victory. Excuse
my being somewhat importunate, though with a man
like you there can hardly be any pretext for it—
however, Ι feel that it will be allowed to pass. Be
careful of your health and continue to love me as
ever.

TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS, IN GAUL

(Q. Fr. 111„ 7.)

Toscnmm) B. c. 54.

AT Rome, and especially on the Appian road as far
as the temple of Mars, there is a remarkable flood.
The promenade of Crassipes has been washed away,
pleasure grounds, a great number of shops. There is
a great sheet of water right up to the public fishpond.
That doctrine of Homer’s is in full play: -

“ The days in autumn when in violent flood
Zeus pours his waters, wroth at sinful men ” —

for it falls in with the acquittal of Gabinius —-

“ Who wrench the law to suit their crooked ends
And drive out justice, recking· naught of Gods.”

But I have made up my mind not to care about such
things. When Ι get back to Rome I will write and
tell you my observations, and especially about the dic-
tatorship, and I will also send a letter to Labienus and
one to Ligurius. I write this before daybreak by the
carved wood lampstand, in which Ι take great delight,
because they tell me that you had it made when you
were at Samos. Good-bye, dearest and best of bro-
thers.

¹ About ten miles southeast of Rome. Cicero had a villa there.
