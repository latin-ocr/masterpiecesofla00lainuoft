AENEAS’ DESC'ENT INTO HADES 233

Leave vouehsafe me to tell the tradition, grace to
exhume -ο

Things in the deep earth hidden and drowned in tlie
hollows of gloom.

So unseen through darkness, amid lone night, they

strode

Down the unpeopled realm of Death‚ and his ghostly
abode‚

As men journey in woods when a doubtful moon has
bestowed

Little of light, when Jove has concealed in shadow
the heaven, 275

When from the world by sombre Night Day's colors
are driven.

Faeing the poreh itself, in the jaws of the gate of the
dead,

Grief‚ and Remorse the Avenger, have built their
terrible bed.

There dwells pale-eheeked Siekness‚ and Old Age
sorrowful-eyed‚

Fear‚ and the temptress Famine‚ and hideous lVant
at her side, 280

Grim and tremendous shapes. There Death with
Labor is joined,

Sleep, half-brother of Death, and the J oys unelean of
the mind.

Murderous Battle is eamped on the threshold. Front-
ing the door

The Iron cells of the Furies, and frenzied Strife,
evermore

Wreathing her serpent tresses with garlands dabbled
m gore. 285
