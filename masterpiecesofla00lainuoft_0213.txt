THE SIEGE OF ALESIA 185

parallel to the Oze, but invisible, flowed the little river
Ozerain. Moving down past the hill of Rea, the
soldiers came to a luiniature plain, which extended,
three miles in length, beneath the western slope of
Alesia, and was bounded on its further side by a
range of heights3 the river Brenne, which received
the waters of the Oze and the Ozerain, meandered
through it from south to north 3 and beyond the Oze-
rain the steep declivities of Flavigny completed the
zone of hills.

Caesar harangued his troops and encouraged them
to brace themselves for a toilsome effort. As it was
evident that the place could not be taken except by a
blockade, he drew a line of investment, fully ten miles
in length, along which a ring of canips was constructed.
Those intended for the cavalry were on low ground,
—three in the plain and one in the valley of the
Rabutin‚ which entered the Oze from the north. The
rest were strongly placed upon the slopes of the out-
lying hills. Close to the camps redoubts or block-
houses, twenty-three in all, were thrown up3 and
strong pickets were placed in them, to guard against
any sudden sortie.

Soon after the commencement of the works, Ver-
cingetorix sent all his cavalry down the hill3 and a
desperate combat was fought in the western plain.
Caesar’s Gallio 1 and Spanish horse were soon in trou-
ble3 and he sent his Germans to reinforce them.
The legions were drawn up in front of their camps,
to deter the enemy’s foot from attempting a sortie.
The Gauls were beaten, and galloped back along the
valleys of the Oze and the Ozerain, hotly pursued by
the Germans: but the gates of the camp being too
