68 LUCRETIUS

Nor was one found to break that thraldom fell

Until a man of Greece dared list his eyes, ⁶⁵
One whom no vengeful thunderbolts could quell

Nor wrath of gods. But on his high emprise‚
Chafed to sublimet* ‹lai-ing and intent,
To burst through Nature's portals forth he went.

Thus his undaunted spirit for mankind τυ
Ο’61· Superstition's power the victory won ;
Past the world's flaming walls his venturous mind
Through the unmeasured universe pressed on;
Thence brought us word how Being is defined
By bounds fast set which nothing may o'er-run. ⁷5
So trampled under foot Religion lies
While Science soars victorious to the skies.

Nor deem it sin by Reason to be freed,
Or think I lead thee an unholy way3
Rather to many a dark and bloody deed 80
Religion hurries those who own her sway.
VVas not Iphigenia doomed to bleed
By the Greek ehiefs‚ though first of men were
they,
Staining the altar of the Trivian Maid
At Aulis where the fleet by winds was stayed? ss

Lo! on her tresses fair for brida] tire
The sacrificial fillet they have bound3
Beside the altar weeping stands her sire:
In all the crowd 110 tearless eye is found.
The priests make ready for their office dire, 90
Yet pitying hide the knife. When gazing round
The Maiden sees her (loom, her spirit dies,
Her limbs sink down, speechless on earth she lies.
