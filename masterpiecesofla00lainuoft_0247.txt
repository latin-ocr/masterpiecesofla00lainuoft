AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 219

Icarus‚¹ into the picture, had grief noi: baffled the
thought.

Twice he essayed upon gold to engrave ‘chine agony,
twice

Faltered the hands of the father, and fell. Each
noble device

Long their eyes had perused, but Achates 2 now is in
sight 3 35

With him the priestess comes, dread servant of
Phoebus and Night,

Daughter of Glaucus the seer. To the Trojan mon-
arch she cries:

“ ’Τ is not an hour, Aeneas, for feasting yonder thine

eyes.

Better to slaughter from herds unyoked seven oxen
and seven

Ewes of the yester year, as a choice oblation to
Heaven.'' 40

Then, as ‘che ministers hasten the rites ordained to
prepare,

Into the depth of the temple she bids Troy's children
repa1r.

There is a cavern hewn in the mountain’s enormous
side

Reached ὴὲ a hundred gates, and a hundred passages
wide.

Thence roll voices a hundred, the seer’s revelations
divine. 45

When by ‘che doors they stood: “’T is the hour to
inquire of the shrine,”

¹ Son of Daedalus, who was drowned while attempting· to accom-
pany his father‘s ssight from Crete.
² Aeneas' faithful companion.
