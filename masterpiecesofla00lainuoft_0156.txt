128 CICERO

tor urbanus, in 63 consul. The year of his consulship
was marked by the conspiracy of Catiline. Successful in
bringing about the execution of some of the most notorious
of the conspirators‚ he was himself subsequently driven into
exile through the machinationis of enemies, who revived a
law according to which any one who ordered the execution

another criticism that is often and perhaps justly made,
namely, that even the most impassioned of his utterances
on state questions show a lack of that moral earnestness
which 1s so prominent a feature of the orations of Demos·
thenes. Yet ev en with these shortcomings Cicero' s orations
are masterpieces of eloquence; and his vivid imagination,
