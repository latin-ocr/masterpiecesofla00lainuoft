XXXIX.

“ Ay, and you yourself in truth
Are a goodly‚ comely youth, . 2³0
Proper, tall, and fair3
Venus and the graces too
Have befriended each of you
For a lovely pair.”

XLII.

Fear not! with the coming year,
The new Torquatus will be here,
Him we soon shall see
With infant gesture fondly seek 250
To reach his father’s manly cheek,
From the mother's knee.

XLIII.

With laughing eyes and dewy lip,
Pouting like the purple tip

That points the rose's bud3 ⁴ 255
While mingled with the mother's grace,
Strangers shall recognize the trace

That marks the Manlian blood.

REMORSE

(LXXVL, υυ. 10 seq.)

WHY longer keep thy beart upon the rack?

Give to thy soul a higher, nobler aim.

And tho' thou tear thy heart out, look not back

In tears upon a love that was thy shame.
