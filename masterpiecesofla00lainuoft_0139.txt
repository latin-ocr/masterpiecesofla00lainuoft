TO DIANA

TO DIANA
(xxxw.)

DIANA guardeth our estate,
Girls and boys immaculate:
Boys and maidens pure of stain,
Be Diana our refrain.

O Latonia‚1 pledge of love
Glorious to most glorious Jove,
N ear the Delian 2 olive-tree
Latona gave thy life to thee,

That thou shouldst be forever queen
Of mountains and of forests green3
Of every deep glen’s mystery ς

Of all streams and their melody:

Women in travail ask their peace
From thee, our Lady of Release:

Thou art the Watoher of the Ways:
Thou art the moon with borrow'd rays 3

And as thy full or waning tide

Marks how the monthly seasons glide,
Thou, Goddess, sendest wealth of store
To bless the farmer’s thrifty floor.

Whatever name delights thine ear,
By that name be thou hallow'd here

¹ Diana, daughter of Latona.
