CATULLUS

 

BIOGRAPHIC AL SKETCH

SWEETEST of Roman singem, Catullus has won the
hearts of his readers both in ancient and in modern times
by his perfect sincerity‚ his exquisite tenderness‚ his abso-
lute ingenuousness. Strange anomaly, a love poet with a
really great love, he has told his story with simple direct-
ness, expressed its varying phases with compelling candor,
traced its course, which ran any way but smoothly, with a
range of feeling that places his lyrics among the truest and
most spontaneous utterances in literature. At once buoy-
ant and. moody‚ with equal capacity for great happiness and
for great suffering, his poems show him now striking the
stars, now plunged in depths of woe. Yet all told, after
reading his “little b00k‚'' with its alternate sunshine aud
shadow, it is the more sombre tone that prevails; and the
lighter pieces, while of lasting charm in themselves from
their exuberanee of spirits, their air of good fellowship,
their humorous and satirical touches, have another and per-
haps, from the point of view of the book as a whole, a still
more striking effect in that they act as soils to those poems
of the Lesbia group in which the poet's feelings find their
most passionate expression. These are of singular inten-
sity‚ some of them written in the heyday of his hopes and
happiness, some in times of doubt and disillusion, some
telling of his struggle between his love for Lesbia. and his
knowledge of her faithlessness, more than one a renuncia-
tion, —- all examples of genuine sels-revelation, the record of
a rare spirit who happened upon inisfortuue.
