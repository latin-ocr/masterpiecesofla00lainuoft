134 CICERO

have done before him 3 and wherefore should his enemy
have wished to put in his way what he ought to have
desired for himself? As it is, I wonder what evil
death has brought him 1 Unless indeed, carried away
by idle taleS, we imagine that he is suffering in the
nether world the punishment of the wicked, and that
he has fallen in with more enemies there than he left
behind him here3 that by the avenging furies of his
mother—in-law,¹ of his wives, of his brother, and of his
children, he has been driven headlong into the place
where the ungodly have their home. If, however,
these representations are untrue, as all must know they
are, what, I ask, has death taken away from him save
the sensation of misery‘?

But again, by whom was the poison administered?
By M. Asellius. What connection had he with Habi-
tus‘? None3 in fact, as he was very intimate with
Oppianicus, he was more probably even on bad terms
with him. Did he then choose the person who, as he
knew, was anything but friendly to himself, and who
was an intimate acquaintance of his intended victim,
to be the instrument of his own crime and of the jeop-
ardy of his foe ἶ) Τ11011 why do you,2 whom filia] piety
has prompted to undertake this prosecution, suffer this
Asellius to go so long· unpunished? Why have you
not followed the example of Habitus, and so secured,
by the conviction of the man who proffered the poison,
a previous verdict prejudicing my client? Again how
incredible it is, gentlemen, that poison should have
been administered in a piece of bread! how unusual!
how strange! Could it diffuse its effects more readily

of his relatives.
