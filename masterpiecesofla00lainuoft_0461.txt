“ ROME 433

the effectiveness of his sententiae, and his powers of vivid
portrayal and word painting. His canvas is crowded with
realistic pictures of Roman life: as, for example, the swarm
of toga-clad clients besieging the door of a rich patron at
dawn‚ some of them not having even the excuse of poverty,
others looking to the dole as their only means of subsistence‚
and to procure it resorting freely to lying and impersona-
tion, and all the devices of shifty poverty3 the scenes in
the streets at Rome on the downfall of Sejanus3 the crowded
tenements whose shoddy construction offered to their occu-
pants at best an option between collapse and conflagration;
the legacy hunters‚ forgers‚ rioters, highwaymen, debauchees,
adulterers, —all characters old to satire, it is true, but never
placed before'in so fiel-ce a light.

ROME ¹
(ΙΙΙ.)

GRIEVED though I am to see the man depart,
Who long has shared, and still must share, my beart,
Yet (when I call my better judgment home)
I praise his purpose to retire from Rome,
And give, on Cumae’s 2 solitary coast,
The Sibyl —— one inhabitant to boast 1
Full on the road to Baiae, Cumae lies,
And many a sweet retreat her shore supplies --
Though I prefer ev'n Prochyta‘s 3 bare strand

1 This satire contains an account of the evils and discomforts of
life in Rome. The speaker (vv 37 to end) is one Umbricius, who is
leaving the capital in disgust. Juvenal represents himself (vv. 1—36)
as having accompanied him to the valley of Egeria, just beyond one
of the city grates, to say good-by.

² On the coast of Campania, the dwelling-plaee of the famous Sibyl,
priestess of Apollo.

²³ A small island off the coast of Campania.
