LETTERS 173

thoughts as have occurred to my mind, not because I
suppose them to be unknown to you, but because your
sorrow may perhaps hindei· you from being so keenly
alive to them.

Why is it that a private grief should agitate you
so deeply? Think how fortune has hitherto dealt
with us. Reflect that we have had snatchedl from us
what ought to be no less dear to human beings than
their children — country, honor, rank, every politica]
distinction. What additional wound to your feelings
could be inflicted by this particular loss? Or where is
the heart that should not by this time have lost all
sensibility and learn to regard everything else as of
minor importance‘? Is it on her account, pray, that
you sorrow? How many times have you recurred to
the thought —— and I have often been struck with the
same idea—that in times like these theirs is far from
being the worst fate to whom it has been granted
to exchange life for a painless death? Now what was
there at such an epoch that could greatly tempt her to
live? What scope, what hope, what heart's solace?
That she might spend her life with some young and
distinguished husband? How impossible for a man
of your rank to select from the present generation of
young men a son-in-law, to whose honor you might
think yourself safe in trusting your child! Was it
that she might bear children to cheer her with the
sight of their vigorous youth? who might by their
own character maintain the position handed down to
them by their parent, might be expected to stand for
the offices in their order, might exercise their freedom
in supporting their friends Ῥ What single one of these
prospects has not been taken away before it was given?

¹ By the triumph of the Caesarian party.
