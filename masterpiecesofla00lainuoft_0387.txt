already gained some expericnce of them in the First
Punic WVar3 and so various was the fortune of this
war, so great its vicissitudeS, that the party which
proved in the end victorious was at times brought the
nearest the brink of ruin. Besides, they exerted in
the contest almost a greater degree of rancor than
of strength, the Romans being fired with indignation
at a vanquished people presuming to take up arms
against their conquerors3 the Carthaginians‚ at the
haughtiness and avarice which they thought the others
