AENEAS‘ DESCENT INTO HADES 251

One huge portal in front upon pillars of adamant
stands 3

Neither ean mortal might, nor the heavens’ own
warrior hands,

Rend it asunder. An iron tower rears over the door,

Where Tisiphonel seated in garments dripping with
gore

Watehes the perch, unsleeping‚ by day and by night
evermore. 560

Hence come groans on the breezes‚ the sound of a
pitiless flail,

Rattle of iron bands‚ and the clanking of fetters that
trail.

Sileni: ‘che hero stands, and in terror rivets his eyes.

‘⁶ What dire shapes of impiety these? Speak, priest-
ess! '' he eries.

‘⁶ What dread tormenta raeks them, and what shrieks
yonder arise ? '’ 565

She in return: “ Great chief of the Teum-ian hosts,
as is meet

Over the threshold of sinners may pass no innocent
feet.

Heeate's sels, who set me to rule the Avernian glade,

Taught me of Heaven's great torments‚ and all their
terrors displayed.

Here reigns dread Rhadamanthus? a king no merey
that knows‚ 570

Chastens and judges the guilty, eompels each soul to
diselose

Crimes of the upper air that he kept coneealed from
the eye,

¹ One of the Fui-ies.
² IIe acted, together with Aeacus and Minos, as judge of the dead„
