“ Withered leaves strew wintry brooks!
Ivy garlands greenly darkling‚
Myrtles brown with dewdrops sparkling,

Best beseem youth’s glowing looks 1 ’' ao

SIMPLICITY
(odes, 1.‚ 38.)

OFF with Persian gear, I hate it,

Hate the wreaths with limebark bound,
Care not where the latest roses

Linger on the ground.

Bring me myrtle, naught but myrtle l ⁵
Myr-tle, boy, will well combine
Thee attending, me carousing‚
'Neath the trellised vine.

A WOMAN’S WORD
(Odes, Π., 8.)

ΒΑΒΙΝΕΣ if some vengeanee dread
Fen on your trebly perjured head,
Did but a single tooth or nail

Turn black, I might believe your tale!

But stin the oftener that you dare ⁵
To outrage heaven with oaths, more fair

That face becomes, and, still the more,

Admirers thieken and adore.
