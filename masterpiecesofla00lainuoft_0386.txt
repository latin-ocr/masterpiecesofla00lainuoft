braided them all together, as slaves of haughty kings,
who, incapable of relishing liberty themselves, had
come to wrest it from others. For a considerable time
they hesitated, looking about for some other to begin
the combat. Then shame at length put their troops
in motion, and setting up a shout, they poured their
javelins from all sides against their single opponent.
But when all these stuck in the shield with which he
guarded himself, and he still persisted in keeping pos-
session of his post, they had now resolved, by making
a violent push, to force him from it, when the crash of
the falling bridge, and at the same time a shout raised
by the Romans, filled them with sudden dismay, and
stopped them from proceeding in the attempt. Then
Cocles said, ‘⁶ Holy father Tiberinus, I beseech thee to
receive these arms, and this thy soldier, into thy pro-
pitious stream.’' With these words, armed as he was,
he leaped down into the Tiber, and through showers of
darts which fell around him, swam safe across to his
friends, having exhibited a degree of intrepidity which
in after times was more generally celebrated than be-
lieved. The state showed a grateful sense of such high
desert: a statue was erected to him in the Comitium,
and he was given a grant of land as large as he could
plough completely in one day. The zeal of private
persons too was conspicuous amidst the honors con-
ferred on him by the public3 for, great as the scarcity
then was, every one contributed something to him,
in proportion to the stock of their family, abridging
themselves of their own proper support.
