FRIENDSHIP 1
(De Amicitia, VL-IX.)

Laelius. Friendship is nothing else than entire
fellow-feeling as to all things, human and divine, with
mutual good-will and affection 3 and I doubt whether
anything better than this, wisdom alone excepted, has
been given to man by the immortal gods. Some pre-
fer riches to it 3 some, sound health3 some, power3
some, posts of honor 3 many, even sensual gratification.
This last properly belongs to beasts3 the others are
precarious and uncertain, dependent not on our own
choice so much as on the caprice of Fortune. Those,
indeed, who regard virtue as the supreme good are en-
tirely in the right3 but it is virtue itself that produces
and sustains friendship, nor without virtue can friend-
ship by any possibility exist. In saying this, however,
I would interpret virtue in accordance with our habits
of speech and of life 3 not defining it, as some philoso-
phers do, by high-sounding words, but numbering on
the list of good men those who are commonly so re-
garded, —the Pauli, the Catos, the Galli, the Scipios,
the Phili. Mankind in general are content with these.
Let us then leave out of the account such good men as
are nowhere to be found. Among such good men as
there really are, friendship has more advantages than
I can easily name. In the first place, as Ennius
says :—

“ How can life be worth living, if devoid
Of the calm trust reposed by friend in friend P

¹ This dialogue is part of the output of the years 45 and 44, which
Cicero devoted almost exclusively to literature. The interlocutors are
Laelius, the intimate friend of Scipio the younger, and his two sons-in-
law Fannus and Scaevola.
