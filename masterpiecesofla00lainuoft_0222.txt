194 CAESAR

was filled up, where necessary, with earth and fascines:
stout sappers’ hutS, destined to protect the men when
they should approach to storm the lines, long poles
fitted with hooks for tearing down the rampart, and
other implements which Vercingetorix had provided,
were carried across3 and the besieged moved on to
make their last effort.

A desperate struggle then began. Wherever there
was a weak spot in the defenceS, the Gauls threw them-
selves upon it 3 and the Romans, comparatively few
in numbers, and scattered owing to the vast extent of
their lines, found great difficulty in massing themselves
upon the exposed points. Mor-cover, they were pain-
fully distracted by the roar of battle in their rear3 for
both on the inner and the outer line men felt, as they
fought, that they must perish if their comrades behind
suffered the enemy to break through. Yet, agitated
as they were, they combated with a nervous eager en-
ergy 3 and the besieged struggled as desperately as
they 3 for both knew that that day's fight would decide
all ε ——the Gauls were lost unless they could break the
line3 the Romans, if they could but hold that line,
saw their long toil at an end. From the slope of Fla-
vigny, south of the Ozerain, the view from which em-
braced the whole plain, Caesar directed the battle, and
sent supports to every point where he saw his men
hard pressed. The attack on the circumvallatiou in
the plain was comparatively feeble3 for the bulk of
the relieving force was formidable only in numbers.
Nor were those numbers wisely directed. The Aedui
may have been treacherous: the generals may have
disagreed, or they may have been fettered by the
civil commissioners3 anyhow the Gauls made no at-
tempt upon the circumvallation, except on Mont Rea
