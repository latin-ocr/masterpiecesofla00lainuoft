1v.
Hymen, come, for J ulia
VVeds with Manlius izo-day,
And deigns to be a bride.
Such a form as Venus wore
In the contest famed of yore,

On Mount Ida's side 3 ¹

V

Like the myrtle οι· the bay,
Florid, elegant, and gay,

With foliage fresh and new 3
Which the nymphs and forest maids

Have foster'd in sequester’d shades,
With drops of holy dew.

VI.

Leave, then, all the rocks and cells
Of the deep Aonian 2 dells,
And the caverns hoar3
And the dreary streams that weep
From the stony Thespian steep‚3
Dripping evermore.

VII.

Haste away to new delights‚
To domestic happy rites,
Human haunts and ways 3
With a kindly charm applied,
Soften and appease the bride,
And shorten our delays.

¹ When Paris awarded to her the golden apple.
2 Aonia was Hie name of that part of Boeotia in which Mount Heli-
con was situated.

³ Mount Helicon, at the soot of which was the city of Thespiae.
