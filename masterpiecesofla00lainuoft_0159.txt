THE SPEECH FOR CLUENTIUS 131.

opportunely present in court a most reputablc and in
every way worthy person, the Senator L. Praetorius,
whose hospitality and intimate friendship this Vibius
enJ‘oyed, with whom he lived at Rome when he was
taken ill, and at whose house he expired. I assert
that he died intestate,·and that the succession to his
estate was by edict of the praetor assigned to Numerius
Cluentius, his sister’s son, whom you see here in'court,
a most honorable and eminently estimable young man,
and a Roman knight to boot.

The second charge of poisoning states that poison
was, at the instigation of Habitus,1 prepared for young
Oppianicus '2 here, when a large company was break-
fasting together, as is the custom at Larinum,³ on the
occasion of his marriage3 and that when it was being
offered him in honey wine, Balbutius,‘¹ one of his
friends, intercepted it on its passage, drank it, and
instantly expired. If Ι were to treat this matter as if
I had an accusation to dispose of, Ι should state at
greater length what I am now cursorily mentioning in
my speech.

What has Habitus ever done that this monstrous
deed should not be thought quite foreign to his char-
acter? And had he any reason for being in such fear
of Oppianicus,⁵ seeing he could not have said one single
word in this ease, while, as you will presently be made
aware, so long as his mother lives my client can never
be free from prosecution? Was it that he wanted
his case to lose no clement of danger, but rather

¹ Τ110 defendant. Habitus was his cognomen.

² Son of Oppianicus.

⁸ A town near the bordei-s of Apulia, where the most important
personages of the trial lived.

4 Mentioned only in this speech.
⁵ The son.
