TO HIMSELF 107

Fair shone 1110 skies on thee when 111011 1ο fare 5
VVast ever fain

Where the girl beekonkl, lov'd as girl shall ne’er
Be lov’d again.

Yes, fain 111011 wasta for merry 111111]1; and she ——
She ne'er said nay. ιο
Α11, gayly 111011 1110 morning smil’d on thee
Each happy day.

Now, 5110 saith nay3 but thou be strong 10 bear,
Harden thy hearb3

Nor nurse thy grief, nor oling 10 her so fair, 15
So fixi: 10 part.

Farewell! Ι ’νο learn'd my Iesson: I 'll endure,
Nor try 10 find

Words that might wake thy 111111, 01· even cure
Thy poison'd. mind. 20

Yet will the time come when thy heart shall bleed,
Accursed one,

When thou shalt come 10 eld with none 10 heed,
Unwooed‚ unwon.

Who 111011 will seek 1110οῬ Who will eall 11100 fair ἶ)
Call 11100 1115 own? 26

Whose kisses and. whose dallianee wilt 111011 share?

Be stone, my heart, be stone.
