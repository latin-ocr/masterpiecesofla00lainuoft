110 CA TULLUS

For your Catullus' purse just now
With spiders' webs is running over.

But anyhOW‚ a welcome warm
And loving shall be your-s, I weeu3

And, for a rarer, daintier charm, 15
A perfume which the Paphian queen1

Gave to my girl, —— so rare, so sweet‚
That, when you smell it, in the throes
Of eestasy you ’ll straight entreat
The gods to make you wholly nose. 20

TO SIRMIO ²

(XXXI.)

O BEST of all the seattered spots that lie

In sea or lake — apple of landscape's eye --

How gladly do I drop within thy nest,

With what a sigh of full contented rest,

Searoe able to believe my journey o’er, 5
And that these eyes behold thee safe once more.
Oh, where ’s the luxury like the smile at heart,
When the mind, boeathing, lays its load apart —
When we come home again, tired out, and spread
The loosened li1nbs o’er all the wished-for bed 3 ιο
This, this alone is worth an age of toil!

Hail lovely Sirmio! Hail paternal soil!

J oy, my bright waters, joy, your master 's come!

Laugh, every dimple on the cheek of home 1
Lmen Hom.
