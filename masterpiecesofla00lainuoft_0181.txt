FRIENDSHIP 153

weak are strong, and —- what seems stranger still —
the dead are alive, such is the honor, the enduring re-
membrance, the longing love, with which the dying are
followed by the living ; so that the death of the dying
seems happy, the life of the living full of praise. But
if from the condition of human life you were to exclude
all kindly union, no house, no city, could stand, nor,
indeed, could the tillage of the field survive. If it is
not perfectly understood what virtue there is in friend-
ship and concord, it may be learned from dissension
and discord. For what house is so stable, what state
so firm, that it cannot be utterly overturned by hatred
and strife? Hence it may be ascertained how much
good there is in friendship. It is said that a certain
philosopher ¹ of Agrigentum sang in Greek verse that
it is friendship that draws together and discord that
parts all things which subsist in harmony, and which
have their various movements in nature and in the
whole universe. The worth and power of friendship,
too, all mortals understand, and attest by their ap-
proval in actual instances. Thus, if there comes into
conspicuous notice an occasion on which a friend in-
curs or shares the perils of his friend, who can fail to
extol the deed with the highest praise‘? What shouts
filled the whole theatre at the performance of the new
play of my guest and friend Marcus Pacuvius, when
—— the king not knowing which of the two was Orestes 2
—Pylades said that he was Orestes, while Orestes
persisted in asserting that he was, as in fact he was,
Orestes 1 The whole assembly rose in applause at this

¹ Empedocles, born about 485 Β. c.

2 The friendship of Orestes and Pylades was proverbial. On this
occasion each insisted that he should be the one to suffer. The king
referred to is Thoas, of the Tauric Chersonesus.
