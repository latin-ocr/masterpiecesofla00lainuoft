AENEAS' DESCENT INTO HADES 231

But the devout Aeneas a vast grave builds on the
r 2
Places Ξιῗζοῐῖ it the warrior’s arms, his trumpet and
Close tgatlhe sky-capped hill that from hence Misenus 1
is hight,
Keeping through endless ages his glorious memory
bright.

Finished the task, to accomplish the Sibyl’s behest
they sped. 240

There was a cavern deep,—with a yawning throat
and a dread, — ,

Shingly and rough, by a sombre lake and a forest of

night

Sheltered from all approach. No bird wings safely
her fiight ’

Over its face, - from the gorges exhales such poison-
ous breath, 244

Rising aloft to the skies in a vapor laden with death.

Here four sable oxen the priestess ranges in line3

Empties on every forehead a brimming beaker of
wme ς

Casts on the altar-fire, as the first-fruits due to the
dead,

Hair from befiween both horns of the victim, plucked
from its head 3

Loudly on Hecate calls, o’er heaven and the shadows
supreme. 250

Others handle the knife, and receive, as it trickles‚
the stream

Warm from the throat in a bowl. Aeneas with fal-
chion bright
