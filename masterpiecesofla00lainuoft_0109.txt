any malady of body. And during the revolution of
many lustres of the sun through heaven they led a life
after the roving fashion of wild beasts. No one then
was a sturdy guider of the bent plough or knew how
to labor the fields with iron or plant in the ground

nized by this long· section at the end of the fifth book, in which the
development of the raee is traced through all the stages from primi-
tive savagcry to civilization and culture.
