438 JUVENAL

And from the womb was nursed on Sabine fare,

Avails me not! our birthright now is lost,

And all our privilege an empty boast! 135
For lo l where versed in every soothing art

The wily Greek assails his patron’s beart,

Finds in each dull harangue an air, a grace,

And all Adonis in a Gorgon face 3

Admires the voice that grates upon the ear, 140

Like the shrill scream of amorous chanticleer3

And equals the crane neck and narrow chest

To Hercules, when, straining to his breast

The giant son 1 of Earth, his every vein

Swells with the toil and more than mortal pain. 145
W e too 0311 cringe as low, and praise as warm,

But flattery from the Greeks alone 0311 charm.

No longer now the favorites of the stage

Boast their exclusive power to charm the age:

The happy art with them a nation shares, 150

Greece is a theatre, where all are players.

For 10 l their patron smiles, — they burst with mirth ;

He weeps, —they droop, the saddest souls on earth ;

Ηο 03115 for fire, — they court the mantle’s heat3

’T is warm, he eries, — and they dissolve in sweat. 155

Ill-matched 1- secure of victory they start,

Who, taught from youth to play a borrowed part,

Can with a glance the rising passion trace,

And mould. their own, to suit their patron's face 3

At deeds of shame their hands admiring raise, 160

And mad (lebauchery’s worst excesses praise-
Turn to their schools :yon gray professor see,

Smeared with the sanguine stains of perfidy!

That tutor most accursed his pupil sold 1

That Stoic sacrificed his friend to gold Ῐ 165

² Antaeus, who lost his strength when lifted from the earth.
