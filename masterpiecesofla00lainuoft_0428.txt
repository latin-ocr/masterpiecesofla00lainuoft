400 TA CITUS

charming little dialogue on the decline of oratory under the
empire. The style, which differs in a striking manner from
that of his other works, shows many signs of Ciceronian
influence. In the Ayricola and Germania, also of small
compass, we see Tacitus tending in the direction of historio-
graphy, the field to which he afterwards confined himself.
Yet neither of these monographs is, strictly speaking, an his-
torical work. The Ayricola is an example of encomiastic
biography, in which the historical form is adopted only to
give the encomiastic element greater effectiveness; while
the Germania, formally and primarily an ethnographical
treatise, seems from its idealization of the simplicity and
virtue of the northern people to indicate some desire on
the part of the author to reflect upon the deterioration of
morals among the Romans.

Of much wider scope are the two great historical works,
the Historiae and the Annales. The former, which in all
probability originally consisted of fourteen books, was a his-
tory of the empire from 69 A. D. to the death of Domitian.
Of this only the first four books and a part of the fifth have
survived, containing an account of 69 and 70, the crowded
years that saw the reigns of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and
the triumph of the Flavians. The Annales (there were
sixteen books in all, but the central portion of the work is
lost) dealt with the period from the death of Augustus in
14 A. D. to the fall of Nero. It is the author’s masterpiece:
of prime importance‚ historically, for its masterly descrip-
tions of politica] situations, and its subtle analysis of the
characters of the great personages of the early e1npire3 of
rare stylistic effectiveness from its wonderful compression,
the infinite variety shown in the structure of clause and
period, and the skillful use of poetic word and phrase.
