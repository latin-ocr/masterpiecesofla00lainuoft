Natura we have, so far as the subject matter goes,
nothing more than an exposition of the theory of
Epicurus, but in the intense seriousness with which
the poet points out the practical bearing of the creed
and its great importance for the conduct of life, the
tone of the work is essentially Roman3 and it is to
this very Roman element that it owes its tremendous
vigor of presentation, its glowing portrayal of the
blessings of Epicureanism. Widely different from
the method of Lucretius is that which Cicero adopted
in his philosophical works, in which weffid'urbanity

the value of literary form as an clement of success.
He did succeed, not only in his own day but in later
centuries as well, when his writings were the princi-
pal medium through which Greek philosophy became
known to western Europe.

Other writers, other fieIdS, other periods might be
drawn upon sor further illustration of the serious
practical trend of the Roman mind, as for example
that great mass of legal lore which, accumulating
year after year for centuries, found a final codification

modern law3 or those writings in which agriculture
had a long series of exponents, ranging from the dry
didacticism of Cato to the poetic elevation of Virgil’s
Georyz'es. Nor can I refrain from mentioning that
sacred band, among whose ranks even so great a
personage as Julius Caesar has a place, the Roman
