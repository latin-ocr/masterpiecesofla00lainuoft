AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 239

When wild people assailed me, a treasure-trove to
their mind.

Now are the waves my masters 3 I toss on the beaeh
in the wind.

O! by the pleasant sun, by the joyous light of the
skies,

By thy sire, and Iulus‚1 the rising hope of thine eyes,

Save me from these great sorrows‚ my hero! Over
me pour πο

Earth, as in truth thou oanst, and return to the
Velian 2 shore.

Else, if a heavenly mother hath shown thee yonder a
way, —

Since some god’s own presence, methinks, doth guide
thee, who here

Seekest to eross these streams and the Stygian
marshes drear, --

Give thy hand to thy servant, and take him with thee

So thassoffssyzluiet places his wearied head he mg}
lay Ι ”

Thus, sad phantom, he eried 3 thus answered the seer
of the shrine:

“Whence‚ Palinurus, eomes this ill-omened longing
of thine ‘?

Thou east eyes, unburied, on Stygian waves, the
severe

Stream of the Furies, approach unbidden the banks
of the mere! aso

Cease thy dream that the F ates by prayer may be
ever appeased,

Yet keep this in remembrance, that so thy lot may be
eased :—
