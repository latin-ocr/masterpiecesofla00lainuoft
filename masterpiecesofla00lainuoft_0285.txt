AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 257

Here are the ancient children of Teucer-,¹ fair to be-
hold,

Generous heroes, born in the happier summers of
old,— 655

Ilus, Assaracus by him, and Dardan, founder of Troy.

Far in the distance yonder are visible armor and
car

Unsubstantial, in earth their lances are planted, and

Over tligrmeadows are ranging the chargers freed from
m lo . ·

All thee dlglight they took when alive-in the chariot
and sword, 660

All of the loving care that to shining coursers was
paid,

Follows them now that in quiet below Earth's breast
they are laid.

Banqueting here he beholds them to right and to left
on the sward,

Chanting in chorus the Paean, beneath sweet forests

of ba

Whence‚ amird wild wood covers, the river Eridanus,
poured, 6⁶5

Rolls his majestio torrents to upper earth and the
da .

Chiefs ἱοέ the land of their sires in the battle wounded
of yore,

Priests whose purity lasted until sweet life was no
more

Faithful pro'phets who spake as beseemed their god
and his shrine, 669

All who by arts invented to life have added a grace,

¹ Teucer, Ilus, Assaracus, and Dardan all belonged, in different
generations, to the royal house of Troy.
