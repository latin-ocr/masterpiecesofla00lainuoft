LUCRETIUS

 

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

S'r. JEROME in his Chronicle places the birth of Lucre-
tius in the year 94, adding that after having become insane
by drinking a love philtre he wrote some books in the lucid.
intervals of his madness3 that he committed suicide in his
forty-fourth year, and that Cicero revised his work. From

fundamental principles that nothing is produced from no-
thing and that nothing returns to nothing, he explains
the existence of the universe, of all forms of life, of all
natural phenomena, as due to the chance combination of an
infinite number of atoms moving in an infinite void. The
atoms have existed from all eternity, and are indestructi-
ble. They are of extreme minuteness, indivisible, and im-
perceptible by any of the senses. Having an inherent
power of deflection they swerve from the, straight line as
they fall, and, colliding, combine in forms of manifold va-
riety. The third book deals with the constitution of the
