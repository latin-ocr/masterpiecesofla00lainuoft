DAMON AND ALPHESIBOEUS1

(Eclogue VIII.)

SONGS of the shepherds Damon and Alphesiboeus,

m theme:

Hearkenillg to whom with rapture as each in rivalry
sung,

Heifers forgot their pasture, upon whose melodies
hun

Lynxes sgitten with wonder, and every listening
stream

Loitered with altered current along its watery way3 5
Damon and Alphesiboeus shall be our burden to-day.

Sailing already abreast of the great Timavus’s hill,2
Whether I find thee‚3 or coasting around Illyria still,
Comes not the bright day ever when this poor tongue

shall be free
Thy fair deeds to proclaim ἶ) Shall I ne'er at liberty
Proudlylrulo wast thy verse o’er earth and her every)

Only oscllffffgns worthy‚ and buskin'd tragedy's prime ¹?
Thou my Muse's beginning, her song shall finish with
thee.

1 Tho Eclogue contains the songs of the two shepherds Damon and
Alphesiboeus, the former telling of the faithlessness of his mistress,
the latter giving the song· of a Thessalian girl who is trying· by magio
to win back her lover.

2 The rocks near the mouth of the river Timavus on the north

shore of the Adriatic.
³ Pollio, to whom the poem is addressed, was on his way home

from a successful campaign in Illyricum, on the east coast of tho
Adriatic.
