A BORE 297

To whom your life is precious ‘? '⁹ ‘⁴ Not a soul ε
My line 's extinct: Ι have intcrred the whole.''
Ο happy they Σ (so into thought Ι fell) ιο
After life's endless babble they sleep well:
My turn is next: dispatch me: for the weird
Has come to pass which I so long have feared,
The fatal weil-d a Sabine beldame sung,
All in my nursery days, when life was young: 45
‘⁶ No sword nor poison e'er shall take him off,
Nor gout, nor pleurisy‚ nor racking cough:
A babbling tongue shall kill him : let him fly
All talkers, as he wishes not to die.’'

We got to Vesta's temple, and the sun 50
Told us a quai-ter of the day was done.
It chanced he had a suit, and was bound fast
Either to make appearance or be cast.
“ Step here a moment, if you love me.'' “ N ay 3
Ι know no law: ’t would burt my health to stay, 55
And then, my call.” ‘⁶ I ’m doubting what to do,
Whether to give my lawsuit up 01· you.”
“ Me, pray 1 ’⁹ ‘⁶ I will not.'' On he strides again :
I follow unresisting‚ in his train.

‘⁶ How stand you with Maecenas ¹? ’⁹ he began ε eo
‘⁶ He picks his friends with eare3 a shrewd wise man:
In fact, I take it, one could hardly name
A head so cool in life's exciting game.
’Τ would be a good deed done, if you could throw
Your servant in his way 3 Ι mean, you know, ⁶5
Just to play second : in a month, I 'll swear‚
You ’d make an end of every rival there.''
‘⁶ Oh, you mistake ε we don’t live there in league:
I know no house more sacred from intrigue :
I 'm never distanced in my friend’s good grace το
By wealth or talent : each man finds his place.'’
