36 TERENCE

Θεία (asido). I’ll approach them. (Aloud.)

Our own Chremes ἵ How do you do ἶ)

Chremes. How do you do, Geta?

Θεία. It 's a great pleasure to see you safe home
again.

Chremes. Yes‚ yes.

Geta. How goes it?

Chremes. I 've found a good many changes here —
the usual experience of one coming home.

Θεία. True, indeed. Have you heard what Anti-
pho has done ‘?

Chremes. Yes, the whole story.

Θεία (to DEMIPHO). Did you tell him‘? What a
shame it was, Chremes, that he should be overreaohed
in that way!

Demipho. That 's what Ι was just telling Chremes.

Θεία. Wess, I ’ve turned the matter over earefully
in my mind, and Ι think Ι 've found a remedy.

Chremes. What is it, Geta?

Demipho. What 's your remedy?

Geta. After leaving you, Ι happened to meet
Phormio.

Chremes. Who ’s Phormio?

Θεία. The man by whom that girl —

Chremes. I understand.

Θεία. Ι thought I might as well sound him, so I
took him aside. “ Come, Phormio,'' Ι said, “ why
should n’t we settle this business in a friendly way,
instead of quarrelling over it‘? My master ’s a gentle-

· man, and does n't care to go to law, though, by Hea-

ven, all his friends just now agreed in advising him
to turn hor out of doors.’'

Antipho (aside). What ’s he up to? Where will
all this end?
