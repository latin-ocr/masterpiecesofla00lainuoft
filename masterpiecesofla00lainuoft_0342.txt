314 PR OPER TIUS

The beaoh is with unpolished pebbles gay,

And birds untutored trill the sweetest lay.

Not thus the damsels of the golden age 15
WVere wont the hearts of heroes to engage:

Their loveliness was to no jewels due,

But to such tints as once Apelles¹ dreW.

From vain coquettish arts they all were free,
Content to eharm with simple modesty. 20
By thee despite to me will ne'er be done3

The woman pleases well who pleases one.

TO MAECENAS2
(H.‚ 1.)

YOU ask, why thus my loves I still rehearse,
Whenoe the soft: strain and ever-melting verse ‘?
From Cynthia all that in my numbers shines 3
She is my genius, she inspires the lines 3
No Phoebus else, no other Muse Ι know ⁵
She tunes my easy rhyme, and gives the lay to flow.
If the loose ourls around her forehead play,

Or lawIess, o’er their ivory margin stray :

If the thin Coan weh-'³ her shape reveal,

And half disolose those limbs it should conceal 3 10
Of those loose ourls, that ivory front I write3

Of the dear web whole volumes I indite:

Or if to musio she the lyre awake‚

That the soft subject of my song I make,

And sing with what a careless grace she flings 15
Her artful hand across the sounding strings.

⁸ A Greek painter of the Alexandrian period.
² The publication of the first book of his Eleyz'es had won for the
poet the favor of Maecenas. ³ Of silk from the island of Coos.
