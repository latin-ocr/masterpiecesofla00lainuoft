322 PROPERTIUS

By him 1 that led the Macedonian home
In chains and all his pride in ruin laid,

N ever for me was bent the censor's law3
N ever by me wrong to your honor done3

Your scutcheon to Cornelia owes no flaw, ³5
To her your roll of worthy names owes one.

Nor failed my virtue ; faithful still Ι stood,
And stainless from the bridal to the bier.
No law Ι needed save my noble blood3
The basely born are innocent through fear. 40

J udge strictly as ye will, within the bound

Of Death’s wide realm not one, matron or maid,
Howe'er renowned in story, will be found

To shun communion with Cornelia’s shade.

Not she, the wife of purity unstained, 45
At touch of whose pure hand Cybele moved‚2
When hands less pure in vain the cable strained,
Not she‚3 the virgin of the gods beloved‚

For whom, when Vesta's sacred fire was lost,

It from her votary's robe rekindled sprang. 50
And thou, dear mother, (lid thy child e'er cost

Thee, save by her untimely fate, a paug?

Short was my span, yet children three Ι bore,
And in their arnis Ι drew my latest breath ;

¹ Aemilius Paullus, who conquered Perseus in 168 Β. c. His son
became a Scipio by adoption.

² The ship that was bearing the image of Cybele to Rome ran
aground in the Τ iber. and it was only when the vestal Claudia. laid
her hand upon tlw cable that it could be moved.

3 The vestal Aemilia.
