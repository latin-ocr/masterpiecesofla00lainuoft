BEA UTY UNADORNED 313

may be, it is his own relation to it that interests him most,
and to himself he almost invariably returi „⁴⁴² If his suffer-
ings were great, the contemplation of them afforded him a
pleasure that was, in part at least, a recompense. His hap-
piness would seem to have reached its highest point in
brooding over his own death and burial.

Unlike that of his contemporary Tibullus his work shows
strong Alexandrian influence. His models were Callimachus
and Philetas, and it is to his imitation of them that the
undu& preponderance of mythological lore and the tendency
to recondite and abstruse allusion are largely due. To the
same source must be ascribed the excessive elaboration of
detail and superabundance of ornament that characterize
some of his elegies. Yet in spite of these faults we find
everywhere traces of a genius of rare brilliancy: imagina-
tion of great range and vividness, deftness in word and
phrase, and a fine ear for rhythmical effects.

BEAUTY UNADORNED
(1.‚ 2.)

DEAR girl,1 what 'boots it thus to dress thy hair,
Or flaunt in silken garment rich and rare,

To reek of perfume from a foreign mart,

And pass thyself for other than thou art -—

Thus N ature’s gift of beauty to deface 5
And rob thy own fair form of half its grace?
Trust me, no skill can greater charnis impart ;
Love is a naked boy and scorns all art.

Bears not the sod unbidden blossoms rare ?

The untrained ivy, is it not most fair? ιο
Greenest the shrub on rocks untended grows,
Brightest the rill in unhewn channel flows.

1 Cynthia.
