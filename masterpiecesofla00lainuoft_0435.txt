CUSTOMS OF THE GERMANS 407

from wheat, and, like the juice of the grape, fermented
to a spirit. The settlers on the banks of the Rhine
provide themselves with wine. Their food is of the
simplest kind : wild apples, the flesh of an animal reâ€”
cently killed, or coagulated milk. without skill in
cookery, or without seasoning to stimulate the palate,
they eat to satisfy nature. But they do not drink
merely to quench their thirst. Indulge their love of
liquor to the excess which they require, and you need

Their public spectacles boast of no variety. They
have but one sort, and that they repeat at all their
meetings. A band of young men make it their pas-
time to dance entirely naked amidst pointed swords
and javelins. By constant exercise this kind of exhi-

their liberty and even their persons on the last haz-
ard of the die! The loser yields himself to slavery.
Young, robust, and valiant, he submits to be chained,
and even exposed to sale. Such is the effect of a ruin-
ous and inveterate habit. They are victims to folly,
and they call themselves men of honor. The winner-
is always in a hurry to barter away the slaves acquired
