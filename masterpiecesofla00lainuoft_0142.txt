CA TULL US

TO LESBIA
(LI.)

HIM rival to the gods I place,
Him loftier yet, if loftier be,

who, Lesbia, sits before thy face,
Who listens and who looks on thee ;

Thee, smiling soft. Yet this delight 5
Doth all my sense consign to death;

For when thou dawnest on my sight,
Ah, wretched ἶ flits my laboring breath.

My tongue is palsied. Subtly hid

Fire ereeps me through from limb to limb ε 10
My loud ears tingle all unbid:

Twin clouds of night mine eyes bedim.

Ease is my plague : ease makes thee void,
Catullus, with these vacant hours,

And wauton : ease that hath destroyed 15
Great kings, and states with all their powers.

W. E. Gmnsromz.
