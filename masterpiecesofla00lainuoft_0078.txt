Antipho. Tell me Phaedria’s plans. What does
he intend to do?

Phormio. He 's going to play your role.

Antipho. My rssle?

Phormio. Yes‚ keep out of his father' s sight. He' s
asked that you play his, and plead his cause, for he’ s
coming to my house to take a few drinks. I ’ll tell
the old gentlemen that 1’ m going to the fair at Su-
nium to buy that slave girl whom Geta was talking
about just nOW‚ so that when they miss me they won't
think that I 'm squandering their money. But listen,
there ’s some one at your door.

Antipho. See who ’s coming out.

Phormio. It ’s Geta.

Geta. And freed us, his friends, from fear! But
Ι 'm wasting time in not throwing my cloak over my
shoulder‚1 and hurrying to tell him what has befallen,
him.

Antipho (to PHORMIO). Do you understand what
he 's talking about?

Phormio. No, do you ἰ)

Antipho. No, not a word.
