264 VIRGIL

Silvius‚1 Alban of name, thy child though born at the
end,

Son of thy later years by Lavinia, eonsorb of thine,

Reared in the woods as a monareh and sire of a royal
line.

N ext to him Procas, the pride of the race3 then
Capys, and far

Numitor3 after him one who again thy name shall
revive, 775

Silvius, highss Aeneas, in pious service and war

Noble alike, if to Alba's throne he shall ever arrive.

Heroes fair! how granelly, behold! their manhood is
shown,

While their brows are shaded by leaves of the citizen-
crown 12

These on the mountain ranges shall set Nomentum3
the steep, τεο

Gabii’s towers, Fidenae's town, Collatia's keep 3

Here plant Inuus' camp, there Cora and Bola en-
throne,

Glorious names ere long, now a nameless land and
unknown.

Romulus, scion of Mars, at the side of his grandsire 4
see -—

Ilia fair his mother, the blood of Assaracus he ! 785

See on his helmet the doubled erest, how his sire has
begun

Mat-king the boy with his own bright plumes for the
world of the sun.

¹ In this and the following lines we have the names of princes of

Alba.

² A crown of oak leaves was awarded for saving a eitizen’s life in
battle.

³ A town in Old Latium. So, τοο, the other places mentioned.

4 Numitor, the father of Rhea Silvia, or Ilja.
