ACME ΛΝΒ SEP TJMJUS 113

The green-eyed lion’s hungry glare,
And none be by to help me there ἔ ” 10

As thus he whispered‚ Love was pleased,
And on the right propitious sneezed.

Then bending gently back her head,
And with that mouth, so rosy-red‚
Impressing on his eyes a kiss, 15
His eyes, that drunken were with bliss‚
‘⁶ Oh, Septimillus, life1’' cried she,
“ So love our only master be,
As burns in me, thine Acme true,
A fire that thrills my marrow through, 2⁰
Intenser, mightier, more divine,
Than any thou eanst feel in thine 1 ’⁹

As thus she whispered, Love was pleased‚
And on the right propitious sneezed.

Now hallowed by such omens fair, 25
anh dotes on each, that happy pair.
He, siek with love, rates Aeme's smiles
Above the East 01· Britain’s isles ;
Whilst Acme, to Septimius true,
For him, him only, doth renew :so
Love’s first delights, and to her boy
Unfolds fresh treasuries of joy.

Were ever souls so lapped in bliss 1

Was ever love so blest as this 1
