THE GREAT FIRE AT ROME 431

checked the growth of a dangerous superstition 3 but
it revived soon after, and spread with recruited vigor,
not only in J udea, the soil that gave it birth, but even
in the city of Rome, the common sink into which
ever-ything infamous and abominable flows like a tor-
rent from all quarters of the world. Nero proceeded
with his usual artifice. He found a set of profligate
and abandoned wretches, who were induced to confess
themselves guilty, and on the evidence of such men a
number of Christians were convicted, not indeed on
clear evidence of their having set the city on fire, but
rather on account of their sullen hatred of the whole
human race. They were put to death, and to their
sufferings Nero added mockery and derision. Some
were covered with the skins of wild beasts, and left
to be devoured by dogs; others were nailed to the
cross 3 numbers were burnt alive 3 and many, covered
over with inflammable matter, were lighted, w'hen the
day declined, to serve as torches during the night.

For the convenience of seeing this tragic spectacle
the emperor lent his own gardens. He added the
sports of the circus, and assisted in person, sometimes
driving a chal-iot, and occasionally mixing with the
rabble in his charioteer’s dress. At length the cruelty
of these proceedings filled every breast with compas-
sion. Humanity relented in favor of the Christians.
The manners of that people were, no doubt, of a per-
nicious tendency, and their crimes called for the hand
of justice, but it was evident that they fell a sacrifice,
not for the public good, but to glut the rage and cru-
elty of one man only.
