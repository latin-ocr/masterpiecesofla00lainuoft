COUNTRY LIFE 293

With well-mouth'd hounds and pointed spear!
’ Or spreads his subtle nets from sight, 50
With twinkling glasses, to betray
The larks that in the meshes light,
Or makes the fearful hare his prey.
Amidst his harmless easy joys
No anxious care invades his health, 55
Nor love his peace of mind destroys,
Nor wicked avarice of wealth.
But if a chaste and pleasing wife,
To ease the business of his life,
Divides with him his household care, σο
Such as the Sabine matrons were,
Such as the swift Apulian's bride,
Suu-burnt and swarthy though she be,
Will fire for winter nights provide,
And without noise will oversee 65
His children and his family3
And order all things till he come,
Sweaty and overlabor’d home 3
If she in pens his flocks will sold,
And then produce her dairy store, το
With wine to drive away the cold,
And unbought dainties of the poor3
Not oysters of the Luci-ine lake ¹
My sober appetite would wish,
Nor turbot‚ or the foreign fish 75
That rolling tempests overtake‚
And hither wast the costly dish.
Not heathpout, or the rarer bird,
Which Phasis ² 01· Ionia, yields,

¹ Properly an inner recess of the Bay of Cumae on the coast of
Campania, famous for its oyster beds.
² A river of Colchis, an Asiatic province east of the Black Sea.
