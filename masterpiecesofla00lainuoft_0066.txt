38 TERENCE

by not having had one, seeing that a girl ’s been found
for him to provide with a dowry.'' His last words
were, “ From the very beginning Ι ’ve been willing, as
in duty bound, to marry my friend's daughter, for I
thought how much she would suffer if, poor as she was,
she were handed over to some rich man as his slave.
But to speak plainly with you, I wanted some one who
would bring me a trifle of money to pay my debts.
Even now, if Demipho is willing to pay me as much
as I shall get with the girl Ι ’111 engaged to, there ’s
110 0116 Ι should sooner have for my wife than Pha-
nium.’'

Antipho (aside). Is this stupidity or malioe? Has
he something in view, or does n't he know what he 's
doing? It 's more than Ι ean tell.

Demipho. But suppose 116 ’s head over heels in
debt‘?

Geta. “ My land‚'’ he said, “is mortgaged for ten
minae.” 1

Demipho. All right, he shall marry her. I ’ll give
the money.

Geta. “ And my house for ten more.''

Demipho. Oh, no ἶ that ’s too much.

Chremes (to Demipho). Be quiet. (To Geta.)
Draw on 1116 for those ten.

Geta. “ Ι must buy a maid for my wife3 Ι need a
little more furniture3 then there are the expenses of
the wedding. Call that another ten.”

Demipho. Let him straightway bring a thousand ac·
tions against me ἶ Ι won’t give him anything! Shall
this infamous scoundrel insult as well as cheat me ἱ)

Chremes. Do be quiet. I ’ll pay it3 all you have
to do is to see that your son marries the girl we want
him to marry.
