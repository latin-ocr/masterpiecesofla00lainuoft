CA TULL US 101

He was born at Verona in 84 B. Ο. Almost the whole
period of his literary activity, however, was spent in Rome,
and it was there that he met Lesbia, as she is called in his
poems, who seems to have given the first stimulus to his
lyrical gift. While her identity has not been finally deter-
mined, it is probable that she was none other than Clodia,
the sister of Clodius, the notorious enemy of Cicero. His
affair with her lasted about four years, from 61-58. In
57 he joined the suite of the propraetor Memmius, who was
going out to Bithynia. On returning to Rome in the fol-
lowing year, he showed an increased interest in politics,
bitterly opposing Caesar and his party. There is 110 refer-
ence in his writings to any event later than 54, and it is
assumed that he died soon after that year.

Besides the Lesbia lyrics, the verses to different friends,
and other occasional pieces, we have a number of epigrams
and some longer poems, among which may be mentioned
the M arriaqe of Peleus and Thetis, an epyllion or miniature
epic, into which is woven the story of Theseus and Ariadne;
the Attis, describing the sels-mutilation of a young devotee
of Cybele; the Epithalamium of ‘seclia and Manlius, one
of the finest products of the poet’s genius ; and Berenice's
Hair, in which the hair itself gives the true history of its
elevation from the head of Berenice, the sister, wife, and.
queen of Ptolemy EuergeteS, to a place in the heavens.
While these, in contrast to the best of the shorter poems,
show in many respects the influenee of the tenets of the
group of ‘⁴ new poets‚'' among whom Catullus' closest liter-
ary friends were, and who, in violent reaction from the
standards of the older national school, looked to Alexan-
drian poetry as the only means of literary salvation, yet
there are in almost all of them striking manifestations of
those qualities of imagination and true poetic insight which
make Catullus one of Rome's greatest poets.
