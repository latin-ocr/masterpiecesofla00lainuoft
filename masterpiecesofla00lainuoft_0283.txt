AENEAS' DESCENT INTO HADES 255

Some on the spokes of a whirling wheel hang spread

to the wind.

Theseus sits, the unblest‚ and will ever seated re-

Phlegyas1 here in his torments a warning voice to
mankind

Raises, loudly proclaiming throughout Hell's gloomy
abodes: 625

‘Learn hereby to be just, and to think no scorn of
the Gods! '

This is the sinner his country who sold, forged tyr-
anny's chain,
Made for a bribe her laws, for a bribe unmade them
Yon Ψῖἶῗῖὶιιῃᾶπθᾶ on a daughter with eyes unholy to
look. 629
All some infamy ventured, of infamy's gains partook.
Had I a thousand tongues, and a thousand lips, and a
Fashioifgtledtll steel‚ sin‘s varying types Ι hardly could
Could ἕῖῗοιξαᾶ thee the roll of the torments suffered

“ Forward‚'' she eries, “ on the path, and complete
thy mission begun. 635

the gate

1 King· of the Phlegyae in Boeotia, who, to avenge his daughter,
set fire to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and was killed by the
arrows of the god.
