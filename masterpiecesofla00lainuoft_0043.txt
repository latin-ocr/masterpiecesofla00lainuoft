PHORMIO 15

Phaedria (asida). Oh, Ι 'll find one ; don’t let
that trouble you.

Demipho. Will it be, “I did it against my will,
the law compelled me '⁹ ‘? well, I concede that.

Geta (asiae). Good.

Demipho. But wittingly and without a word, to let
your opponents win — did the law compel you to do
that?

Phaedria (asicle). That 's a hard one.

Geta (aeide). I ’11 fix it ; leave it to me.

Demipho. Ι don't know what I'm to do, seeing
that this has happened. It ’s such a surprise that Ι
can hardly believe it even now. I ’m so upset that Ι
can't bring myself to think it over. It shows that
every one, even at the height of prosperity, should con-
sider ways and means of bearing adversity — danger,
loss, exile. A man returning from a journey should
always keep in mind the possibility of his son being
in a serape, his wife being dead, 01· his daughter ill ; he
should remember that these are the common incidents
of life, and so prevent their surprising him. What-
ever turns out well contrary to his expectation, should
bereckoned assoxnuch gabr

Geta (asiae). Oh, Phaedria, it ’s hard to believe,
but I ’m away ahead of my master in philosophy, for
I 've considered all the disagreeable things which may
befall me on his return ε to grind corn in the mill, be
flogged, wear chains, work as a field hand. None of
these things will surprise me. W‘Vhatever turns out
well contrary to my expectation, Ι shall reckon as so
much gain. But why don't you go up to him and
begin to coax him ‘?

Demipho. Why, here 's my nephew Phaedria.

Phaedria (qoinq up to him). How ‹lo you do,

uncle ⁴?
