DIDO TO AENEAS 333

But now with northern blasts the billows mar, 185
And drive the floating sea-weed to the shore.
Leave to my care the time to sail away ;
When safe‚ I will not suffer thee to stay.
Thy weary men would be with ease content3
Their sails are tattered, and their masts are spent. 190
If by no merit I thy mind can move,
What thou deniest my merit, give my love.
stay, till Ι learn my loss to undergo,
And give me time to struggle with my woe:
If not, know this, Ι will not suffer long 3 195
My life ’s too loathsome, and my love too strong.
Death holds my pen, and dictates what I Say,
While cross my lap the Trojan sword I lay.
My tears fiow down 3 the sharp edge cuts their flood,
And drinks my sormws, that must drink my blood. 200
How well thy gift1 does with my fate agree!
My funeral pomp is cheaply made by thee.
To no new wounds my bosom I display ;
The sword but enters where love made the way.
But thou, dear sister,2 and yet dearer friend, 205
Shalt my cold ashes to their urn attend.
Sychaeus' wife let not the mal-bie boast ;
I lost that title, when my fame I lost.
This short inscription only let it bear3
“ Unhappy Dido lies in quiet here. 210
The cause of death, and sword by which she died,
Aeneas gave 3 the rest her arm supplied.’'

ALEXANDER Porss.

¹ The sword. According to Virgil's story (Aeneid, IV.)‚ Dido had
given it as a present to Aeneas, and he had accidentally left it be-
huEdi-&unm who had been her confidante throughout the affair with
Aeneas.
