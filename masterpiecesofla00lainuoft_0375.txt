PHAETHON 347

Now there she rushes, frantie, kissing this

Or that while yet she ean, and strives to rend

Their bodies from the elasping bark‚ and tears

The fresh leaves from their sprouting heads, and sees,

Aghast, red drops as from some wound distil. 416

And “Ah‚ forbear1” the sufferer shrieks —— “For-
bear,

Ο mother dear! Our bodies in these trees

Alone are rent! Farewell 1 ’' And o’er the words

Scarce uttered closed the bark, —and all was still. 420

But yet they weep ε - and, in the sun, their tears
To amber hasdeu, by the clear stream caught

And borne, the gaud and grace of Latian maids.
