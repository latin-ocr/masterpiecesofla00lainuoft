JULIA AND MANLIUS 123

With expectation warni, 195
The bridegroom views her coming near, -
The slender youth ¹ that led her here

May now release her arm.

XXXIV.

With a fix’d intense regard

He beholds her close and hard 200
In awful interview:

Shortly now she must be sped

To the chamber and the bed,
With attendanee due.

XXXV.

Let the ancient worthy wives, 205
That have pass’d their constant lives
With a single mate‚2
As befisss advised age,
With couneil and precaution sage
Assist and regulate. 210

XXXVI.

She the mistress of the band

Comes again with high command,
“ Bridegroom‚ go your way3

There your bride is in the bower,

Like a lovely lily flower, 215
Or a rose in May.

¹ Probably one of the boys who had conducted her during the pro-
eesslon.

² Only matrons who had been but once married were allowed to as-
sist.
