324 PROPERTIUS

Learn, children, to forestall your sire's decline,
And let no lonesome thought come near his life3

Add to your years what Fate has reft from mine ;
Blest in my children let him bless his wife.

Though brief my day, I have not lived in vain3 85
Mourning for child of mine I never wore3

When from my home went forth my funeral train,
Not one was missing there of all Ι bore.

My cause is pleaded. Now, ye mourners rise
And witness bear till earth my meed deeree 3 90
If worth may claim its guerdon in the skies‚

My glorious ancestors may welcome me.
Gomwm Sm'rn.
