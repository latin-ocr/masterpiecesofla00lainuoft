236 VIRGIL

Over the sea’s deep hollows‚ when winter, chilly and
frore,

Drives them across far waters to land on a sunnier
shore.

Yonder they stood, each praying for earliest passage,
and each

Eagerly straining his hands in desire of the opposite
beach.

Such as he lists to the vessel the boatman gloomy re-
ceives, 320

Far from the sands of the river the rest he chases and
leaves.

Moved at the wild uproar‚ Aeneas, with riveted eyes ε

“Why thus crowd to the water the shadows‚ priest-
ess‘?'' he cries3

“ What do the spirits desire? And why go some
from the shore

SadJy away, while others are ferried the dark stream
o’er ? '’ 325

Briefly the aged priestess again made answer and

“ Son ffaifkenchises, sprung most surely from gods
upon high,

Yon is the deep Cocytus marsh‚ and the Stygian lake.

Even the Immortals sear to attest its presence and
lie!

These are a multitude helpless, of spirits lacking a
grave3 330

Charon the ferryman 3 yonder the buried, crossing the
wave.

Over the awful banks and the hoarse-voiced torrents
of doom
