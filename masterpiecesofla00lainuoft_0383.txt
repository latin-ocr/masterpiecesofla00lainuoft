THE RAPE OF THE SABINE WOMEN 355

the whole multitude of the Sabines came with their
wives and children. They were hospitably invited to
the different houses, and when they viewed the sit-
uation and the fortifications and the city crowded
with houses, they were astonished at the rapid increase
of the Roman power. WVhen the show began and
every person’s thoughts and eyes were attentively en-
gaged on it, then, according to a preconcerted plan,
on a signal being given, the Roman youth ran dif-
ferent ways to carry off the young women. Some
they bore away as they happened to meet with them,
without waiting to make a choice3 but others of ex-
traordinary beauty, being designed for the principal
senators, were conveyed to their houses by plebeians
employed for that purpose. It is said that one highly
distinguished above the rest for her bcauty was car-
ried off by the party of one Talassius3 and that in
answer to many who eagerly inquired to whom they
were hurrying her, they, every now and then, to pre-
vent any interruption in their course, cried out that
they were carrying her to Talassius: 1 this circumstance
gave rise to the use of that word at weddings. The ter-
ror occasioned by this outrage put an end to the sports 3
and the parents of the young women retired, full of
grief, inveighing against such a violation of the laws
of hospitality, and appealing to the god to whose
solemn festival and games they had come, relyiug on
the respect due to religion and on the faith of nations.
Nor did the women who were seized entertain better
hopes with regar-d to themselves, or a less degree of
indignation. However, Romulus went about in person

¹ ‘⁶ Talassio ’' was a cry raised at bridal processions. It was prob-
ably of Sabine origin, and the explanation given by Livy here is in-
correct.
