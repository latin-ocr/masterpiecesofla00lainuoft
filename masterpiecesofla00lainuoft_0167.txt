THE SPEECH FOR CLUENTIUS 139

aroused suspicion 3 and when Strato was openly charged
with the crime, the boy who had been his accomplice
became greatly terrified and made a clean breast of the
matter to his mistress. The bodies were found in the
fishpond. Strato was thrown into prison, and fur-
thermore the money, though by no means all of it, is
discovered in his shop.

A criminal investigation is instituted into the theft.
What else can one suppose? Do you tell me that
after the pillaging of the box, the abstraction of the
money (which was not all recovered), and the murder
of the slaves, it was concerning the death of Oppian-
icus that the inquiry was appointed? Can you satisfy
any one of this ‘? Is there anything more improbable
that you could have brought forward? To pass over
other points, was inquiry held into the death of Oppi-
anicus three years after his decease? Aye, and even
on this occasion, inflamed by her former hatred, she
again demanded Nicostratus for a groundless exami-
nation. At first Oppianicus refused3 but afterwards,
when she threatened to take away her daughter and
alter her will, a most faithful slave, to humor a most
bloodthirsty woman, was by him not given up for ex-
amination but simply handed over to the executioner.

Well, then, after an interval of three years, the
inquiry into her husband’s death was reopened. Who
were the slaves examined? A fresh charge was alleged,
I suppose, and suspicion was directed against fresh
persons — Strato and Nicostratus ἶ) What! had not
these men been examined at Rome? Can it be that
you, Sassia, with guilt now to aggravate the distemper
that had before infui-iated your woman's heart, aster
having held an inquiry at Rome at which it had been
determined, on the representation of T. Annius, L.
