A RURAL FESTIVAL 311

The youth whose heart the soft 0111011011 10015,

Νοι· sighs for wealth‚ nor waits at grandeur’s heels ;
Age fired by Love is toueh'd by shame no more, 85
But blabs its follies ab the fair one's door!

Led by soft Love, the tendet, trembling fair

Steals 10 1101· swain, and cheats suspicion’s care,

With outstretched arms she wins her darkling way,
And tip‘coe 11510115 that 110 110150 betray! 90

Ah, wretched those on whom dread Cupid frown81
How happy they whose mutual choice he crowns 1
Will Love partake the banquet of the day?

Ο 001110 - but throw thy burning shafts away.

Ye swains, begin 10 mighty Love the song, 95
Your songS‚ ye swains‚ to· mighty Love belong!
Breathe 0111 aloud your wishes for my sold,

Your own soft vows in whispers may be told.
But hark! loud mirth and 11111510 fire 1110 crowd —
Ye now may venture 10 request aloud 1 100

Pursue your sports3 night 1110111115 1101· curtain’d
wain 3

The dancing stars compose her filial train 3

Black muffled sleep steals on with 5110111 pace,

And dreams flit last, imagination’s race!
