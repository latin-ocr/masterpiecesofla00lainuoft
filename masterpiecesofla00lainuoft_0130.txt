ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF LESBIA’S SPARROW
(ῙΠ·)1

LOVES and Graces mourn with me,
Mourn, fair youths, where’er ye be !
Dead my Lesbia's sparrow is,
span-ow, that was al] 1161· bhss,
Thau her very eyes more dear3

For he made her dainty cheer,
Knew her well, as any maid

Knows her mother, never strayed
From 1161· bosom, but would go
Hopping round her, to and fro,
And to her, ¹and her alone,
Chirrup'd with such pretty tone.
Now he treads that gloomy nack,
WVhence none ever may come back.
Out upon you, and your power,
Which all fairest things demur,
Oreus' gloomy shades‚ that e’er

Ye took my bird that was so fair!
Ah, the pity of it ! Thou

Poor bird, thy doing 't is, that now
My loved one’s eyes are swollen and red,
With weeping for her darling dead.

Sm THEODORE: MAR'rm.
