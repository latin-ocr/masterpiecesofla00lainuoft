THE GOLDEN MEAN 285

It answers then to treat with soorn 1

A parent’s ashes, and suborn ιο
The silent stars and heavenly powers,

To favor falsehood such as yours.

For Venus laughs at woman's wiles ;

The Graoes laugh, and Cupid smiles,

All as he barbs his glowing darts 15
On whetstone red with bleeding hearts.

Besides, each day augments your train,

anh hour new charnis your slaves enohain ;
Nay, even those who late forswore

Your roof still linger round the door. 20

The mothers for their striplings dread,
Old men, and virgins lately wed‚
Lest thine alluring air delay

The bridegroom on his homeward way.

THE GOLDEN MEAN
(odes, 11., 10.)

LICINIUS‚ wouldst thou steer life's wiser voyage,

Neither launeh always into deep mid-waters,

Nor hug the shores, and, shrinking from the tempest,
Hazard the quioksand.

He who elects the golden mean of fortune, ⁵

Nor where dull squalor rots the time-worn hovel,

Nor where fiel-oe envy storms the new-built palace,
Makes his safe dwelling.

¹ To swear falsely by them.
