Else you shall sup alone for me.

A ROMAN DAY
(Epigrams‚ 1V.‚ s.)

VISITS 2 consume the first, the second hour3
When comes the third, hoarse pleadersss show their
power.
At four to business Rome herself betakes;
At six she goes to sleep ;4 by seven she wakes.
By nine, well breat-hed from exea-eise, we rest,
And in the banquet hall the couch is pressed.

With mighty hand while Caesar5 holds the bowl,
WVhen draughts of nectar have relaxed his soul.
Now trifles pass. My giddy Muse would fear

Jove to approach in morning mood severe.
