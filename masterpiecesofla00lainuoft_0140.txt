112 CA TULLUS

And as of old be good to us,

The lineage of Romulus.
R. C. 51:1³3.

TO CORNIFICIUS

(xxxvm.)

CORNIFICIUS, ill is your Catullus,
Ill, ah heaven, a weary weight of anguish,
More, more weary with every day, with each hour.

You deny me the least, the very lightest
Help, one whisper of happy thought to cheer me. 5

Nay, Ι 'm sorrowful. You to slight my passion?
Ah! one word, but a tiny word to eheer me,

Sad as ever a tear Simonidean.1

ACME AND SEPTIMIUS

(ΧΠ.)

SEPTIMIUS cried, as on his breast
His darling Acme he caressed,
‘⁴ My Acme, if I love not thee
To madness, ay, distracteclly,
And with a love that well I know 5
With time shall fonder, wilder grow
In Libya may I then, my sweet,
Or India's burning deserts meet

¹ The allusion is to the patlwtic quality of the work of Simonides,
the Greek lyric poet, (rho-467 Β. (3.).
