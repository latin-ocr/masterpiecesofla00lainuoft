JULJA ΛΝΒ MANLIUS 115

ΤΗΕ EPITHALAMIUM OF JULIA AND MAN-
LIUS ¹

(LXI.)

1.²

YOU that from the mother's side
Lead the lingering‚ blushing bride,
Fair Urania⁷s son —

Leave awhile the lonely mount,

The haunted grove and holy fount 5
Of chilling Helicon.

11.

With myrtle wreaths enweave thy hair —
Wave the toroh alost in air—

Make no long delay ε
With flowing robe and footsteps light, ιο
And gilded buskins glancing bright,

Hither bend thy way.

ΙΙΙ.

J oin ab once, with airy vigor,
In the danoe's varied figure,
To the Cymbal’s chime: 15
Frolic uni-estrain’d and free —
Lei: voice, and air, and verse agree,
And the toreh beat time.

¹ The poem was written for the marriage of Manlius Torquatus,
one of Catullus' friends.

² Stauzas i.—viii. contain an invocation to Hymen, God of marriage.
