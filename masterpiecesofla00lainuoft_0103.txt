THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD 75

contend with swans, or what likeness is there between
the feats of racing performed by kids with tottering
limbs and by the powerful strength of the horse?
Thou, father, art discoverer of things, thou furnishest
us with fatherly precepts, and like as bees sip of all
things in the flowery lawns, we, O glorious being, in
like manner seed from out thy pages upon all the
golden maxims, golden I say, most worthy ever of end-
less life. For soon as thy philosophy issuing from a
godlike intellect has begun with loud voice to pro-
claim the nature of things, the terrors of the mind are
dispelled‚ the walls of the world part asunder, I see
things in operation throughout the whole void3 the
divinity of the gods1 is revealed and their tranquil
abodes which neither winds do shake nor clouds
drench with rains, nor snow congealed by sharp frosts
harms with hoary fall: an ever cloudless ether o’er-
canopies them, and they laugh with light shed largely
round. Nature too supplies all their wants and no-
thing ever impairs their peace of mind. But on the
other hand the Acherusian quarters ² are nowhere to
be seen.
H. A. J. Mumzo.

¹ The well-known description of the gods of the Epicureans in
Tennyson's Lucretius is a reminiscence of this passage, which in its
turn goes back to some lines in the Odyssey of Homer.

2 No abiding place of the dead is discerned by the poet in the plan
of the universe revealed to him. As an argument in favor of the
mortality of the soul, this is hardly cogent.
