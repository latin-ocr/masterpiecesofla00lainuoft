LI VY 349

For the most part he kept aloof from public life and de-
voted himself exclusively to his historical work. The story
that he was the tutor of Claudius. afterwards emperor, does
not rest on very substantial foundations. It is, however,
quite possible that it was on his suggestion that the prince
turned his attention to historiography. It was after the
accession of Tiberius that he retired to Padua, where he
died in 17 A. D.

Judged from the point of view of modern historical re-
search, Livy’s work is open to criticism on many counts:
there is a very limited use of original sources even where
original sources were easily accessible3 he shows but a scant
knowledge of legal and constitutional history 3 he is not al-
ways wise in his choice of authorities3 and very frequently
we find a leaning in the direction of the pieturesque aud
the dramatic that does not make for accuracy of statement.
Yet whatever defects his work may have, its merits far out-
weigh them. And most conspicuous of these is his success
in makingdhis subssect vital. He has revivified the dry
bones of history found' 1n the jejune accounts of the annal-
ists. Ἢόόνῐί scepticism in all matteis of early history has
not prevented his giving us glowing pictures of the valious
alleged occurrences that had become a part of Rome' s tra-
dition. The ,personalitiesofthekingffi of the first consuls,
and of all the heroes who had added their quota to the sum
of their country's greatness, stand out clearly defined, and
this long gallery of national porti-aits is a notable fea—
ture of his history, Equally effective is his treatment of
situations and events within historic times. He has the
artist's gift of singling out important ancl interesting ele-
ments, and reproducing them in rich phrases and rolling
periods that remind us of the best period of Roman oratory.
Now it is a scene in the Roman senate, now some phase of
the struggle between the patricians and the plebeians. now
a foreign war3 but everywhere, no matter what the subject
is, we find the same charm, the same distinction of style,
