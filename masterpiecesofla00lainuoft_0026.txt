age of Nero, show that even at that date tragedy
had not escaped from its Greek leading-strings. Here
again we have the same old themes of Greek mythology,
and such changes of manner as we find in the intro·
duction of lurid details and melodramatic situations,
in the constant striving for epigrammatic and senten-
tious effeots‚ do not make for an increase in strength.
The fundamental cause of this failure in the higher
forms of dramatic expression is probably to be found
in the Roman lack of creative power in art. This
resulted in the production of plays which, adhering
closely to Greek models, failed by the very remote-
ness of their subjects to hold audiences which were,
for the most part, of a low grade of culture, and whose
interest in gladiatorial and similar exhibitionS, part
of their heritage as a fighting people, was encouraged
more and more by the ruling class.

In the selections that follow an attempt has been
made to give a representation of Latin literature
in English translations. That some authors, some
works that might reasonably be looked for are not
represented is due either to lack of space or to the
fact that there are no good translations of them.

Plautus, for example, does not appear, for the reason ·

that, only a certain amount of space being available
for comedy, it seems probable that one play printed
in its entirety will give a better idea of the class to
which it belongs than shorter selections from differ-
ent authors. The Phormio of Terence has accord-
ingly the double function of representing both its au-
thor and the type known as the Fabula Palliata. This
plan of giving selections of considerable length and
of as much integrity as possible has been followed
