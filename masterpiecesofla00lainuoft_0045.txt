PHORMIO 17

laid a trap for us, and won the ease, is it our fault,
or the fault of the jury, who often, as you know, east
the rich from envy, and find for the poor from eom-
passion.

Geta (aside). If Ι did 11't know the details of the
trial, Ι should really believe that he was telling the
truth.

Demipho. Can any juryman get at the right and
wrong of a ease, when the defendant acts as he did
and says never a word?

Phaedria. Any other well—bred young fellow might
have done the same: when he appeared in eourt he
could n’t deliver the speech he had prepared3 his mod-
esty was too much for him.

Geta (asida). Phaedria 's fine! But why don't
I accost the old fellow‘? (qoinfs up to him.) How do
you do, master ἶ) Ι ’m delighted to see you safe home
again.

Demipho. O worthy guardian! true prop of the
family! to whose care I commended my son when I
went abroad l

Geta. Ι 've heard you for some time maligning us,
and me most unjustly of all. Why, what did you ex—
pect me to do in this trial? The law does n’t allow a
slave to plead, nor can he be called as a witness.

Demipho. I pass over all that3 Ι admit the defenoe
that he was young, unsophisticated, afraid to speak3
I allow your plea of being a slave 3 but however
nearly related the girl might be, he need n't have inar-
ried her. You should have given her a dowry, as the
law directs‚ and she should have hunted up another
husband. On what reokoning did he choose to marry
a pauper ?

Geta. It was n’t a reekoning, but eash that we
wanted.
