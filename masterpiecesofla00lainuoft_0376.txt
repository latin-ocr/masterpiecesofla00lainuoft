LIVY

 

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

THE greatest prose work of the Augustan age is the Hm-
tory of Rome from its earliest beginnings to 9 Β. c. by
TitIssTivius. It was in all probability the author' s intention
to b1ing the narrative down to his own times, but he died,
before he had accomplished hssssitask· There were one hun-
dr‘e‘d ‘and “forty-two books in all, of which only thirty-five
have survived, namely the first, third, fourth, and part of
the fifth decade. The work was originally published in
parts of varying length, as the presence of prefaces at vari-
ous points in the narrative indicates. The division into
decades was made by publishers of the fourth or fifth cen-
tury.

According to St. J erome's version of Eusebius, Livy was
born at Padua in 59 B. c. He carne of a good family and
was carefully educated. Rhetoric was the most prominent
element in the school curricula of the time, and in his case
even special emphasis seems to have been laid upon it. He
acquired, moreover, an adequate knowledge of literature,
both Greek and Latin, and his interest in philosophy is at-
tested by the fact that he wrote some dialogues on themes
which fall within that field. He was probably about thirty
years of age when he came to Rome, where he continued to
reside till almost the close of his life. In the Civil War his
sympathies had been with the party of Pompey, but Au-
gustus harbored no resentment against him on this account,
and the friendliest relations existed between the two men.
