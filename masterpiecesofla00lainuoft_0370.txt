Eryx, and Cynthus, Othrys, Rhodope

N ow first of snow dismantled, Dindyma, 250

Mimas, and Mycale, and thou, for rite

Of Bacchus famed, Cithaeron. Little now

May Scythia’s snows avail her 1 Caucasus

Flares with the rest: —— Ossa and Pindus burn,

And, huger yet, Olympus, and the Alps 255

Heaven-towering, and the cloud-capped Apennine!

And now, where'er he turns 1115 glauce, the Youth

Sees but a world on fire 3 nor heat so great

Sustaius‚ and, panting‚ draws each breath of air

Scorching as furnace-blast, and feels the car 260

Beneath him glow, — with ashes 31111 thick shower

Of fiery fragments choked, and blind with cloud

Of stifling smoke z — nor where he was, or is,

Or goes, 0311 longer tell, but at the will 264

Of those mad steeds whirls giddy through the skies!
’T was then, they say, the Aethiop ¹ —all his blood

Drawn outward to the surface — first assumed

That darker hue he wears : — then Libya first,

Of all her moisture drained, 311 arid waste

Became. Then with dishevelled looks the Nymphs 270

For their lost founts went wailing. Sudden ceased

Boeotian Dirce : — Amymone failed

Her Argives 1- 31111 in Ephyra thy wave,

Pirene, gushed no more. Nor rivers, proud

Of widest bank and broadest flood, escaped 275

The ruin. Tanais in mid-chaunel smoked‚

And aged Peneus, and thy Mysian stream,

Cai'cus, and Ismenus swift, and thine,

Arcadian Erymanthus, — Xanthus, doomed

Later again to burn, — thy yellow wave, 28⁰

Lycormas, and Maeander, pleased to stray

¹ Used generally of the inhabitants of Africa.
