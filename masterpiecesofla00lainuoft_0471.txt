ROME 443

The impetuous blazc which spreads dismay below
By swift degi-ees will rcach the a'c'rial cell,
Where crouching underneath the tiles you dwell, 280
Where your tame doves their golden couplets rear,
And you could no mischance but drowning sear!
Codrus 1 had but one hed, and that too short
For his short wife3 his goods, of every sort,
Were else but few ε — six little pipkins graced 285
His cupboard head, a little can was placed
On a snug shelf beneath‚ and near it lay
A Chir0n‚2 of the same cheap marble— clay.
And was this all? O no ε 110 yet possesst
A few Greek books, shrined in an ancient chest, 290
Where barbarous mice through many an iulet crept,
And fed on heavenly numbers while he slept. -
“ Codrus, in short, had nothing.” You say true3
And yet poor Codrus lost that nothing too!
One curse alone was wanting to complete 295
His woes ε 11131 cold and hungry through the street
The wretch should beg, and in the hour of need
Find none to lodge, 10 0101110 111111, 01 to feed 1
But should the raging flames 011 grandeur prey,
And low in dust Asturius’ 3 palace lay, 300
The squalid4 matron sighs‚ the senate mourns,
The pleaders cease, the judge the court adjourns3
All join to wail the city's hapless fate,
And rai] at fire with more than common hate.
Lo ! while it burns‚ the obsequious courtiers haste 305
With rich materials to repair the waste :
This brings him marble, that, a finished piece‚

¹ Named as a representative of the poorer class of Romans.
² A statuette of the centaur Chiron.

3 A rich man.

⁴ In mourning.
