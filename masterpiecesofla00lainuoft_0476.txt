448 JUVENAL

YVhether I strive some humble plea to frame,
Or steal in silence by, 't is just the same3 425
I ’m beaten first, then dragged in rage away3
Bound to the peace, or punished for the fray!
Mark here the boasted freedom of the poor!
Beaten and bruised, that goodness to adore,
Which at their humble prayer suspends its ire, 4³0
And sends them home with yet a bone entire!
Nor this the worst; for when deep midnight reigns,
And bolts secure our doors, and massy chains,
NVhen noisy inns a transient silence keep,
And harassed nature wooes the balm of sleep, 435
Then thieves and murderers ply their dreadful trade.
With stealthy steps our secret couch invade ε
Roused from the treacherous calm, aghast we start,
And the flashed sword is buried in our heart ἕ
Hither from bogs, from rocks, and caves pursued
(The Pontine marsh and Gallinarian wood 1), 411
The dark assassins flock as to their home,
And fill with dire alarms the streets of Rome.
Such countless multitudes our peace annoy,
That bolts and shackles every forge employ, 445
And cause so wide a waste, the country fears
A want of ore for mattocks‚ rakes, and shares.
Ο ! happy were our sires, estranged from crimes ;
And happy, happy, were the good old times
Which saw, beneath their kings’, their tribunes’ reign,
One cell the nation's criminals eontain 1 451
Much could Ι add, more reasons could I cite,
If time were ours, to justify my flight3
But see! the impatient team is moving on,
The sun declining, and I must be gone. 455

² The Pontine marshes in Latium and the Gallinariam wood in Cam-
pania were infested by brigands.
