ROME 449

Long since the driver murmured at my stay,
And jerked his whip to beckon me away.
FareweH, my friend 1 with this embraee we part!
Cherish my memory ever in your heart3
And when from erowds and business you repair, 460
To breathe at your Aquinum freer air,
Fail not to draw me from my loved retreah
To Elvine Ceres, and Diana's seat: ¹
For your bleak hills my Cumae I 'll resign,
And (if you blush not at such aid as mine) 465
Come well equipped to wage in angry rhymes
Fieree war with you on follies and on crimes.
WmLIAM GJFFORD.

¹ There were temples of Ceres and of Diana at Aquinum. It has
been suggested that the former was erected by a member of the Hel-
vian gens, — hence the epithet.
