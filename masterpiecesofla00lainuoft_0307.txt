TO THE SHIP OF STA TE 279

What are you doing? Seek the harbor’s lee
’ Ere ’t is too late!

Do you bemoan 5
Your side was stripped of oarage in the blast ⁴?
Swift Afrious has weakened‚ too, your mast ;
The sailyards groan.

Of oables ¹ bare,
Your keel ean scarae endure the lordly wave. ιο
Your sails are rent3 you have no gods 2 to save,
Or answer pray'r.

Though Pontio pine,

The noble daughter of a far-famed wood,

You boast your lineage and. title good‚-— 15
A useless line!

The sailor there
In painted sterns no reassuranoe finds3
Unless you owe derision to the winds‚'
Beware — beware 1 20

My grief erewhile,
But now my care —my long-ing 1 shun the seas
That flow between the gleaming Cyclades?
Each shining isle.

to prevent the planks from springiug asunder.

2 Images of gods were carried in the sterns of Roman ships. Here
they are represented as having been washed overboard.

⁸ The Aegean Sea in the neighborhood of the Cyclades was pro-
verbially dangerous.
