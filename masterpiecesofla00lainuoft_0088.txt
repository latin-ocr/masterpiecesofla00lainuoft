60 TERENCE

Nuus-istrata. A wicked and terrible thing, by the
immortal gods!

Phormio (ovcrhectrinq CHREMES). Do‘? There 's
nothing left to do.

Phormio. VVas there ever anything more disgrace-
ful ἱ)

Μ(ιι8ἱ3ί)’(ιία. Ι address you, Demipho, for it makes
me sick to talk to that creature. lVas this the rea-
son of his travelling so often to Lemnos and stay-
ing there so long? Was this the cause of the fall
in prices which brought down our income?

Demipho. Nausistrata, I admit that he deserves
blame in this matter, but it is n’t an unpardonable
offence.

Phormio (asido). He 's pleading for the dead.

Demipho. It was n't, you must understand, because
he was tired of you, or because he disliked you, that
he did this. It all happened about fifteen years ago.
He had been drinking when he met the woman. This
girl was born, but 118 never had anything to do with
the mother afterwards. She 's dead and gone now3
the only difficulty is removed. So, Ι beg you, be pa-
tient in this, as you have been in all other matters.

Mmsistrata. I patient? Ι am indeed sorely anx-
ious that this should be his last offence, but how can
I hope for that? Am I to suppose that he will grow
steadier as he grows older? Why, he was old when
he did it3 so much for years bringing steadiness l
Are my looks and age likely to be more attractive to
him now than they were then, Demipho? What
grounds do you give me for expecting or hoping that
he won’t do it again?

Phormio. Now 's the time for all who would attend
the funeral of Chremes 1 That 's the way I 'll give it
