‘⁶ She the maiden, half afraid,

Hears the new proposal made,
That proceeds from thee3

' You resign and hand her over

To the rash and hardy lover
With a fix'd decr-ee.

Maintaining honor and the pride

Of women free from blame,

With a solemn warram: given,

That can do the same ἱ)

Passes unreproved and free,
But without thee, not:
Where on earth, or in the sky,
Can you find a deity
With a fairer lot ἶ)

Is sacred as a gift of thine‚
But without thee, not :

Can you find a deity
With a fairer lot?

Are rightful as derived from thee,
