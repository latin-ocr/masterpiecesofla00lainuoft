and harlots‚ with which through habit they became
daily more and more delighted, enervated both their
minds and bodies to such a degree that they owed
their preservation rather to the name they had ac-
quired by their past victories than to their present
strength. In the opinion of persons skilled in the
art of war the general was guilty of a greater fault
in this instance than in not leading his army directly
to the city of Rome after the battle of Cannae; for
that dilatory conduct might be supposed only to have
deferred the conquest for a time, whereas this latter
error left him destitute of the strength to effect it.
Accordingly he marched out of Capua as if with a
different army, for it did not retain in any particular
the slightest remnant of the former discipline. Most
of the men returned to the field encumbered with
harlots 3 and, as soon as they began to live in tents,
and were obliged to undergo the fatigue of marches
and other military labors‚ like raw recruitS, their
strength both of body and mind failed them 3 and
from that time, during the whole course of the sum—
mer campaign, great numbers used to steal away
from their standards without leave3 and the only
lurking-place of all these deserters was Capua.
