AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 271

Longer had been vouchsafed 1 What wailing of
warriors bold
Shall from the funeral plain to the VVar-god's city be

Y

What slazluzifflp thine eyes will discern, what pageant
When ll} vll'l'2e’11ew-made tomb thy Walters, Tiber‚ shagll
Never jgzvivn· such hopes shall a youth of thy lineage‚
Rouse ἱῖΐὲξζ great forefathers of Latium! Never a
Nobler bggride shall inspire in the ancient Romulus
Ah, forlhxlztllial love ! for his old world saith! for his

Matehless in battle! Unharmed what foeman had
offered to stand

F orth in his path, when charging on foot for the en-
emy's ranks,

Or when plunging the spur in his foam-fiecked
courser's flanks l

Child of a nation’s sorrow! if thou canst baffle the

Fates'

Bitter deerees, and break for a while their barrier
gates, 895

Thine to become Marcellus! I pray thee, bring me
anon

Handfuls of filies, that Ι bright flowers may strew on
my son,

Heap on the shade of the boy unborn these gifts at
the least,

Doing the dead, though vainly, the last sad service.''
