24 TERENCE

Phormio. But now do you, who are so wise, go to
the magistrateS, and ask them for a new trial, since it
seems that you are sole monarch here, and can get
judgment given twice in the same case.

Demipho. Though Ι ’ve been wronged, yet rather
than be involved in a lawsuit, or listen to your talk,
I ’ll give her the dowry which the law orders, just as
if she really were related to me. Away with her, and
take five minae.

Phormio. Ha, ha! you 're delightfull

Demipho. What’s the matter? Is n't my request
reasonable? Am I to be refused even this, the com-
mon right of citizens?

Phormio. And pray does the law order you to pay
her off and get rid of her, after you 've done what
you liked with her, just as if she were a courtesan?
Does it not, on the contrary, order that she be given
in marriage to her next of kin, to live with him all
her days, lest poverty should drive her to evil courses?
And this is what you forbid.

Demipho. Yes, to her next of kin3 but how do we
come in? or why?

Phormio. Oh, my good sir, “don't plead a lost
cause‚'' as the saying is.

Demipho. What! not plead my cause? I’ll not
stop till I 've gained my point.

Phormio. Nonsense!

Demipho. You ’ll see.

Phormio. Resides, we have nothing to do with you,
Dmnipho3 judgment has been given against your son,
not against you 3 your time for marrying has passed.

Demipho. You 're to think that he says everything
that I say 3 or I ’ll turn him out of doors, wife and all.

Geta (aside). He 's furious.
