LETTERS 181

This day and this ear-nest appeal from me were the
first things that inspired the Roman people with the
hope of recovering its liberty. And had not Ι sup-
posed that a gazette of the city and of all acts of the
senate was transmitted to you, Ι would have written
you out a copy with my own hand, though Ι have been
overpowered with a multiplicity of business. But
you will learn all that from others. From me you
shall have a brief narrative, and that a mere sum-
mary. Our senate is courageous, but the consulars
are partly timid‚ partly disaffected. We have had a
great loss in Servius.1 Lucius Caesar entertains the
most loyal sentiments, but, being Antony's uncle, he
refrains from very strong language in the senate.
The consuls are splendid. Decimus Brutus is cover-
ing himself with glory. The youthful Caesar 2 is be-
having excellently, and Ι hope he will go on as he has
begun. You may at any rate be sure of this — that,
had he not speedily enrolled the veterans, and had not
the two legions transferred themselves from Antony’s
army to his command, and had not Antony been con-
fronted with that danger, there is no crime or cruelty
which he 3 would have omitted to practise. Though Ι
suppose these facts too have been told you, yet Ι
wished you to know them still better. Ι will write
more when I get more leisure.

1 Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who had died while on an embassy to

Antony.
2 Afterwards Augustus.
⁸ Antony.
