magisterial sentence upon you. You must pay the
money Iam out of pocket to the last farthing, and
you will find the sum no small one. I had provided
for each guest one lettuce, three snails, two eggS‚ spelt
mixed with honey and snow (you will please reckon up
the cost of the latter as among the most costly of all,

cucumbers, onions, and a thousand other equally ex-
pensive dainties. You would have listened to a come-
dian, or a reciter, or a harp—player, or perhaps to all,
as Ι am such a lavish host. But you preferred to dine
elsewhere—where I know not— off oysters‚ sows'
matrices, sea-urchins, and to watch Spanish dancing
girls! You will be paid out for it, though how I de-
cline to say. You have done violence to yourself.

have enjoyed ourselves, how we should have laughed
together, how we should have applied ourselvesl You
can dine at many houses iu better style than at mine,
but nowhere will you have a better time, or such a
simple free and easy entertainment. In short, give
me a trial, and if afterwards you do not prefer to ex-
cuse yourself to others rather than to me, why then
Ι give you leave to decline my invitations always.
