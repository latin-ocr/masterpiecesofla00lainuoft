A JUGGLER 397

Our quiet days at pleasure spend
And taste of life indeed,

We 'd bid farewell to marble halls,
The sad abodes of state,

The law, with all its dismal brawls,
The trappings of the great3

We ’d seek the book, the oheerful talk,
At noonday in the shade,

The bath, the ride, the pleasant walk
In the cool colonnade.

Dead to our better selves we see
The golden hours take ssight,
Stil] seored against us as they fiee,

Then haste to live aright.

A JUGGLER
(Epigrams, 1X.,3S.)

LITTLE‚ nimble Agathine‚

What consummate art is thine!
Play thy postums, one and all3

N ever will the target ¹ fall.

Thee it follows everywhere:
Swooping through the easy air,

To thy hand 01· foot it flies,

On thy back or shoulder lies.
Slipp’ry footing proves 110 dread,
Though the shower Coryciau ² shed ι

¹ Shield.
² The stage was sprinkled with saffron from Corycus in Cilicia.
