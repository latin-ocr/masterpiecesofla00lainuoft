A LJTERARY HOST 395

THE DINER-OUT
(Epigrams‚ 11.‚ 11.)

BEHOLD, on Selius’ brow, how dark the shade3

How late he roams beneath the colonnade3

How his grim face betrays some secret wound3

How with his nose he almost sorapes the ground 3

He beats his breast, he rends his hair. What now?
Has Selius lost a friend, or brother? N o!

His brace of sons still live, long be their life!

Safe are his slaves, his chattels, and his wife 3

His steward's, his bailiff's books are right— what doom

So dire has fallen on him? He dines at home!
Gonnwm Smin-11.

A LITERARY HOST1
(Epigrams‚ 111„ 50.)

THE single cause why you invite

Is that your works you may recite.

I hardly had my slippers ² dropped,
Nor dream’d the entertainment stopp'd,
When, 'mid the lettuoes and salad,

Is usher'd in a bloody ballad,

Then, lo! another bunch of lays,
While yet the primal service stays.
Another, ere the second course3

A third, and fourth, and fifth you force.
The boar, beroasted now to ragS‚
Appears in vain : the stomaoh flags.

1 The epigram is addressed to one Ligurinus, who gave a dinner
party for the sole purpose of reading his poems to the guests.

² The Romans used to have their sandals taken off on reclining at
table.
