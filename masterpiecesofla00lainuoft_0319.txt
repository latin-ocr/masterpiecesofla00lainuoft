COUNTRY LIFE 291

Reels to the fury of the blast,

The merchant trembles, and deplores

Not his own fate, but buried stores

From Cyprian or Phoenician shores 3—

He with sad vows and unavailing prayer 75
Rich ransom proffers to the angry Gods :

Ι stand ereot: no groans of mine shall e'er
Affront the quiet of those blest abodes ε

My light unburthened skiff shall sail

Safe to the shore before the gale, so

While the twin sons 1 of Leda point the way,

And smooth the billows with benignant ray.

Sm STEPHEN DE VERE.

COUNTRY ΗΒΕ
(Epodes‚ Π.)

“ How happy in his low degree,
How rich in humble poverty, is he
Who leads a quiet country life3
Disoharg’d of business, void of strife,
And from the griping scrivener free! 5
Thus ere the seeds of vioe were sown,
Liv'd men in better ages born,
Who plough'd, with oxen of their own,
Their small paternal field of corn.
Nor trumpets summon him to war, 10
Nor drums disturb his morning sleep,
Nor knows he merchants' gainful care,
Nor {ears the dangers of the deep.
The clamors of contentious law,
And court and state, he wisoly Slmns, 15

¹ Castor and Pollux, who watched over max-iners.
