PH ORMI 0 13

Antipho. Ι ’m beside myself.

Θεία. But, Antipho, this is just the time when you
should n't be beside yourself, for if your father sees
that you ’re afraid he ’ll think that you 're to blame.

Phaedria. That ’s true.

Antipho. Ι can't change my character.

Θεία. How would you manage if you had some-
thing harder to do t> ’

Antipho. Why, since Ι can't do this, Ι should be
still less able to do that.

Θεία. There 's nothing in this, Phaedria3 let 's be
off. Why are we wasting time here ? Ι 'm going.

Phaedria. And I too.

Antipho. Oh, pray! Suppose I pretend to be brave‘?
(feiyninfy an eoepressc‘on of boldness). Will this do?

Θεία (not turning] round). You ’re talking non-
sense.

Antipho. Look at my face, both of you. Νονν, will
this do ‘2

Geta. No.

Antipho. Well‚ then, this?

Geta. Almost.

Antipho. This, then.

Θεία. That will do. Now stick to that, and see
that you answer him word for word, tit for tat, and
don’t let him, however angry he may be, get the better
of you by his savage abuse.

Antipho. I understand.

Θεία. You were forced into it against your will by
the law, the sentence passed upon you, do you under-
stand? But who 's the old gentleman I see at the
end of the street?

Antipho. 'T is he himself. Ι can’t stay.

Θεία. Oh, what are you doing, where are you going,
Antipho? Stop, stop!
