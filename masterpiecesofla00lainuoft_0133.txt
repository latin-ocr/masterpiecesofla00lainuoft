To LESBIA 105

ΤΟ LESBIA
(V-)

LIVING, Lesbia, we should e'en be leving.
Sour severity, tongue of eld maligning,
All be to us a penny’s estimation.

Suns set only to rise again to-morrow.
We, when sets in a little hour the brief light, 5
Sleep one infinite age, a night for ever.

Thousand kisses, anon to these an hundred,
Thousand kisses again, another hundred,
Thousand give me again, another hundred.

Then once heedfully eounted all the thousands, 10
We 'll uneount them as idly 3 so we shall not
Know, nor traitorous eye shall envy,1 knowing

All those myriad happy many kisses.

Rossmson Erus.

TO THE SAME
(VH)

DOST thou, Lesbia, ask that I
Say how many of thy kisses
Would my craving satisfy,

Yes, would surfeit me with blisses ?
