332 OVJD

Some god, thou sayest, thy voyage does command 3

Would the same god had barred thee from my land 1

The same, I doubt not, thy departure steers,
Who kept thee out at sea so many years3
While thy long labors were a price so great,
As thou, to purchase Troy, wouldst not repeat.
But Tiber 1 now thou seek'st, to be at best,
W'hen there arrived, a poor precarious guest.
Yet it deludes thy search 3 perhaps it will

To thy old age lie undiscovered still.

A ready crown and wealth in dower I bring,
And, without conquering, here thou art a king.

Here thou to Carthage may’st transfer thy Troy 3

Here young Ascanius may his arms employ ;
And, while we live secure in soft repose,

Bring many laurels home from conquered foes. ‚

By Cupid's arrows, I adjure thee stay!
By all the gods, companions of thy way 1
So may the Trojans‚ who are yet alive,
Live still, and with no future fortune strive3
So may thy youthful son old age attain,
And thy dead father's bones in peace remain;
As thou hast pity on unhappy me,
tho knew no crime, but too much love of thee.
I am not born from fierce Achilles' line,
Nor did my parents against Troy combine.
To be thy wife if I unworthy prove,
By some inferior name admit my love.
To be secured of still possessing thee,
Ι What would I do, and what would I not be 1

Our Libyan coasts their certain seasons know,

When, free from tempests, passengers may go3

¹ Latium was the Trojans' promised land.
