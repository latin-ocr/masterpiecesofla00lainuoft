THE BATTLE OF THE BEES 215

Echoes the thunder of his rout, and through
Avernian inlets pours the Tuscan tide ‘?

A land no less that in her veins displays

Rivers of silver, mines of copper ore,

Ay, and with gold hath flowed abundantly. 40
A land that rear-ed a valiant breed of men,

The Marsi 1 and Sabellian youth, and, schooled

To hardship‚ the Ligurian, and with these

The Volscian javelin-armed, the Decii 2 too,

The Marii and Camilli, names of might, 45
The Scipios‚ stubborn warriors, ay and thee,

Great Caesar, who in Asia's 3 utmost bounds

With conquering arm e'en now art driving back

The unwarlike Indian from the heights of Rome.
Hail‚ land of Saturn‚4 mighty mother thou 50
Of fruits and heroes ; ’t is for thee I dare

Unseal the sacred fountains‚ and essay

Themes of old art and glory, as I sing

The song of Ascra⁵ through the towns of Rome.
