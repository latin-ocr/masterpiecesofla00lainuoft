74 LUCRETIUS

The sense thrills through you of some pitiless Power
Who scowls at once your father and your foe3

x.

XVII.

Who lets his children wander at their whim,

Choosing their road, as though not bound by him:
But all their life is rounded with a shade,

And every road goes down behind the rim!

XVIII.

And there behind the rim, the swift, the lame,
At different paces, but their end the same,

Into the dark shall one by one go down,
Where the great furnace shakes its hair of fiame.

XIX·

Oh ye who cringe and cower before the throne
Of him whose heart is fire, whose hands are stone,
Who shall deliver you from this death in life ——
⁷ Strike off your chains, and make your souls your

own ?
W. Η. MAnmcK.

THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

(111.‚ 1—30.)

THEE,¹ who first wast able amid such thick dark-
ness to raise on high so bright a beacon and shed
a light on the true interests of life, thee I follow,
glory of the Greek racc, and plant now my footsteps
firmly fixed in thy imprinted marks, not so much from
a desire to rival thee as that from the love I bear thee
I yearn to imitate thee3 for why need the swallow
