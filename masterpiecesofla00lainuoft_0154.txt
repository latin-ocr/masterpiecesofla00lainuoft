AT HIS BROTHER’S GRAVE1
(01.)

O'ER many a sea, o'er many a stranger land,
I bring this tribute ² to thy lonely tomb,
My brother! and beside the narrow room
T hat holds thy silent ashes weeping stand.
Vainly I call to thee. Who can command ⁵
An answer forth from Orcus' dreary gloom‘?
Oh, brother, brother, life lost all its bloom‚

When thou wert snatched from me with pitiless
hand!

VVoe, woe is me, that we shall meet no more Σ
Meanwhile, these gifts accept, which to the grave 10
Of those they loved in life our sires of yore
With picus hand and reverential gave -
Gifts that are streaming with a brother’s tears!

And nOW‚ famwell, and rest thee from all fears 1
Snz THEODORE Mun-m.

1 Catuuus’ brother died in the Troad, and was buried there.
² Offerings of wine, milk, and flowers.
