ITALY 213

Nor blazed so oft the comet's fire of bale.

Therefore a second time 1 Philippi saw

The Roman hosts, with kindred weapons rush 30
To battle, nor did the high gods deem it hard

That twice Emathia2 and the wide ohampaign

Of Haemus 3 should be fattening with our blood.

Ay, and the time will come when thereanigh‚
Heaving the earth up with his curved plough, 35
Some swain will light on javelins by foul rust
Corroded‚ or with ponderous harrow strike

On empty helmam, while he gapes to see

Bones as of giants from the trench untombed.
JAMES Rnomns.

ITALY
(Georgics, ΙΙ., 136-176.)

ΒΗΤ no, not Mede-land with its wealth of woods,
Fair Ganges, Hermus4 thick with golden silt,

Can match the praise of Italy3 nor Iud,

Nor Bactria,5 nor Panchaia,6 one wide tract

Of incense-teeming sand. Here never bulls 5
With nostrils snorting fire upturned the sod

Sown with the monstrous dragon’s teeth, nor crop

Of warriors bristled thick with lance and helm 3

But heavy harvests and the Massic ⁷ juice

¹ Virgil's geography is vague. The decisive battle between Caesar
and Pompey had been fought at Pharsalia in Thessaly. Philippi,
where Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Octavian and Antony,
was in Macedonia.

2 A part of Macedonia.

⁸ The Balkan range.

4 A river in Aeolis in Asia Minor.

⁵ Properly Bactra, the capital of the province of Bactriana in Asia.

θ The fabulous spice-isle off the coast of Arabia.

⁷ Mons Massicus in Campania was famous for its vineyards.
