BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

LITTLE or nothing is known about the early life of Tacitus.
The year of his birth can only be approximately given as
54 A. D„ and the assertion sometimes made that Interamna
in Umbria was his birthplace rests on extremely unsubstan-
tial evidence. It is quite possible that he was born at Rome,
and we know for certain that he studied rhetoric there. It
has been suggested that possibly the Cornelius Tacitus rnen-
tioned by the elder Pliny as procurator of Belgio Gaul was
the historian’s father, but there is no proof of this, and the
details of his family relations are unknown to us, except the
fact that in 78 he married the daughter of Julius Agricola,

Tacitus’ career was at first pursued along political lines.
He held some minor office under Vespasian, was quaestor
under Titus, and praetor under Domitian. After his praetor-
ship (88 A. D.), he was absent from Rome for some years,
possibly serving as propraetor of Belgio Gaul. He returned
in 93, the year of Agricola's death, but does not seem to
have taken any part in public life during the remainder
of Domitian’s reign. In 97, under Nerva, he was made con-
sul. A few years later we hear of him as associated with
his friend the younger Pliny in the indictment of Marius
Priscus for extortion in the province of Africa. After
this he retired‚ and devoted himself exclusively to his
literary and historical pursuits. His death probably took
place about 116 A. 1). ·

His first literary work was the Dialoqus de Oratoribus, a
