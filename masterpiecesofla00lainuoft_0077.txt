Chremes. Heavens, what luekl Ι ’ve found my
daughter married to your son.

Demipho. Eh! how eould that be?

Chremes. I ean’t explain here. It 's not safe.

SCENE 4.

Enter ANTIPHO.

Antipho. However my own affairs may turn out,
I 'm glad my cousin has got what he wanted. How
shrewd to have a love affair of the kind that when
things go wrong, a remedy is possible! As soon as
Phaedria found the money, all his troubles were at an
end3 but I ean't by any device free myself from my
difficulties. To keep my secret means to live in dread3
to reveal it, disgraee. Ι should n't go home now, if
some hope 01 keeping her had n't been held out to
me. But where ean Ι find Geta?

Emer Pnonmo.

Phormio (not seeinq ANTIPHO). Ι ’ve received
the money, paid it over to the slave-trader, and taken
the girl away. I 've seen that Phaedria has her 101
his very own; she ’s been set free. Now, I’ve still
one thing 1611 10 do, and that ’s 10 get away from the
old gentlemen for a spree. That’s how I ’ll spend
the next few days.

Antipho. Why, there 's Phormio. Say!
