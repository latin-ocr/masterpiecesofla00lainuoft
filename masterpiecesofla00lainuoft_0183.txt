FRIENDSHIP 155

111 reflecting, then, very frequently on friendship,
the foremost question that is wont to present 113011 13,
whether friendship is craved on account 01 00113010113
infirmity and need, so thatin bestowing and receiving
the kind offices that belong to it each may have that
done for him by the other which he is least able to
do for himself, reciprocating services in like manner3
or whether, though this relation 01 1111111131 benefit is
the property of friendship, it has yet another cause,
more sacred and more noble, and derived more genu-
inely from the very nature 01 111311. Love, which in
our language gives name ¹ 10 friendship, bears a chief
part in unions of mutual benefit 3 for a revenue of. ser-
vice is levied even on those who are cherished in pre-
tended friendship, and are treated with regard from
interested motives. But in friendship there is nothing
seigned‚ nothing pretended, and whatever there is in
it is both genuine and spontaneous. F riendship,
therefore, springs from nature rather than from need,
— from an inclination of the mind with a certain
consciousness of love rather than from calculation 01
1110 benefit to be derived from it. Its real quality
may be discerned even in some classes of animals,
which up to a certain time so love their offspring, and
are so loved by them, that the mutual feeling is plainly
seen,— 3 feeling which is much more clearly manifest
in man, first, in the affection which exists between chil-
dren and parents, and which can be dissolved only by
atrocious guilt3 and in the next place, in the springing
up of 3 like feeling 01 love, when we find some 0110 01
manners and character congcnial with our own, who
becomes dear 10 113 because we seem to see in him an
illustrious example of probity and virtue. For there
