PROPERTIUS

 

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

OF the life of Propertius, unquestionably the greatest

of Roman elegiae poets‚ very little is known in addition to
the few facts that he himself relates. He was an Umbriam,
and of the various places which have claimed him, Assisi
probably has the strongest case. The year 50 Β. c. may be
given as an approximate date for his birth. He was a
member of the Maecenas circle in Rome, but of all his lit-
erary contemporaries Ovid alone mentions him. In none
of his poems do we find a reference to any event later than
16 Β. 0., and with some show of reason his death is gener·

The first, commonly known as the Cynthia, from the name
of the woman who constitutes its principal theme, was
published When he was only twenty. It shows extraordi-
nary precocity on the technical as well as on the emotional
side. In the second and third books the erotic element is
still prominent, but Cynthia is no longer the poet‘s only
thought. In the fourth and fifth books there is greater
variety. National themes are introduced, and some poems
dealing with the origins of Roman customs and institutions
mark the first attempts by a Roman poet in the field of the
aetiological elegy.

centred, gloomy‚ and morbid. No matter what his theme
