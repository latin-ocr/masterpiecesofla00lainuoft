20 TERENCE

Phormio. It ’5 this way: the net is not spread for
the hawk or the kite, that do us harm3 it 's laid for
those that do us none at all. In the one ease there ’5
profit, in the other mere labor lost. Men who have
something to lose are exposed to divers perils, but I
have nothing, and everybody knows it. What ’5 that
you say? Have me eonvioted, and take me to jail?
No, no! they don’t care to support a big eater, and
to my mind they ’re wise not to wish to requite an in-
jury by the greatest of favors.

Geta. Antipho will never be able to reward you as
you deserve.

Phormio. That ’s true, but then no one is ever as
grateful to his patron as he ought to be. Just think!
You go to his house scot-free, you 've had your bath,
been anointed, there 's not a care on your mind, while
he has all the worry and expense. You have a good
time, he frets and fumes. You may laugh, drink
first, take your place first. Then a puzzling dinner is
set before you.

Geta. What do you mean by that?

Phormio. One where you are puzzled which dish
you had better taste first. Reekoning up how plea-
sant, how dolieious these things are, should n't you
regard the man who furnishes them as a god incar-
nate?

Geta. Here ’5 the old man! Mind what you 're
doing3 it's the first onset that ’5 always the fiercest.
If you hold your own in that, all the rest will be mere
play. [They retire to back of staye.
