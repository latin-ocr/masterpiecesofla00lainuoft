DIDO To AENEAS 329

So often wrecked, how darest thou tempt the main ‘?
Which were it smooth‚ were every wave asleep,

Ten thousand forms of death are in the deep.

In that abyss the gods their vengeance store‚

For broken vows of those who falsely swore3 60
There winged storms on sea-born Venus wast,

To vindicate the justice of her state.

Thus I to thee the means of safety show3

And, lost myself, would still preserve my foe.

False as thou art, I not thy death design 3 65
Ο rather live, to be the cause of mine!

Should some avenging storm thy vessel tear,

(But heaven forbid my words should omen bear Ι)
Then in thy face thy perjured vows would fly,

And my wronged ghost be present to thy eye 3 το
With threatening looks think thou behold’st me stare,
Gasping my mouth, and clotted all my hair.

Then‚ should forked lightning and red thunder fall,
What couldst thou say, but, “ Ι deserved them all '’‘?
Lest this should happen, make not haste away3 -
To shun the danger will be worth thy stay.

Have pity on thy son,1 if not on me3

My death alone is guilt enough for thee.

What has his youth, what have thy gods deserved,
To sink in seaS‚ who were from fires preserved? 80
But neither gods nor parent didst thou bear 3

Smooth stories all, to please a woman’s ear,

False as the tale of thy romantio life.

Nor yet am I thy first-deluded wife3

Left to pursuing foes Creiisa 2 stayed‚ ⁸5
By thee, base man, forsaken and betrayed.

¹ Ascanius, who accompanied his father from Troy.
² Aeneas's Trojan wife. Dido accuses him of having left her be-
hind intentionally when he fied from Troy.
