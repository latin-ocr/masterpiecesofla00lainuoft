CA TULL US

F ear not that the sun
Will dawn upon a fairer face, —
Nor in his airy, lofty race

Behold a lovelier one.

XXI.

Mark and hear us, gentle bride3
Behold the torches nimbly plied,
Waving here and there ;
Along the street and in the porch‚
See the fiery-tressed torch
Spreads its sparkling hair.

XXII.

Like a lily, fair and chaste‚
Lovely bride, you shall be placed

In a garden gay,

A wealthy lord's delight and pride 3

Come away then, happy bride,
Hasten‚ hence away !

XXIII.

Mark and hear us — he, your lord,
Will be true at bed and board‚
Nor ever walk astray,

Withdrawing from your lovely side 3

Mark and hear us, gentle bride,
Hasten, hence away !

XXIV.

Like unto the tender vine,
He shall ever clasp and twine,
Clinging night and day,
