TO FABULLUS 109

Said -— “ Dear Catullus, I am going

To worship at Serapis’ 1 shrine —-—

Do lend me, pray, those slaves of thine 1 '’

I answer'd — ‘⁶ It was idly said, —

They were a purchase Cinna made 35
(Caius Cinna, my good friend) —

It was the same thing in the end,

Whether a purchase οι· a loan -

I always used them as my own 3

Only the phrase was inexact — 40
He bought them for himself, in fact.

But you have caught the general viee

Of being too correct and nice,

Over eurious and precise3

And seizing with preeipitation 45

The slight neglects of conversation.’'

TO FABULLUS

( XIII.)

YOU (line with me, Fabullus mine,
On Friday next, at half-past two:

And I ean promise that you ’ll dine
As well as man need wish to do 3

If you bring with you, when you come, 5
A dinner of the very best,

And lots of wine and mirth, and some
Fair girl to give the whole a zest.

But bring all these you must, I vow,
If you ’re to find yourself in clover, 10
