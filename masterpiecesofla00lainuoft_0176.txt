148 CICERO

rucini ¹ no less distinguished than they ; from Teanum
Apulum2 and from Luceria2 you see honorable Ro-
man knights come to speak his praise3 from Bovia-
num and from the length and breadth of Samnium
most flattering panegyrics have been forwarded, and
<men of the highest consideration and renown have
also come in person. And as to those who have pro—
perty, business avocations, or grazing stock in the ter-
ritory of Larinum, honorable men of the highest dis-
tinction, it were hard to speak of their solicitude and
anxiety. Few, I think, are loved by one as this man
is by them all. How sorry Ι am that L. Volusienus, a
man of the greatest distinction and worth, is not pre-
sent at this trial! Would that P. Helvidius Rufus,
an eminently illustrious Roman knight‚ could be here
when Ι speak his name! Sleepless day and night in
my client’s interests, while he was instructin g me in the
case he fell seriously and dangerously ill ς and yet even
in his illness he is as anxious about the defendant's
safety as about his own recovery. His evidence and
eulogy will make you aware of no less enthusiasm on
the part of that excellent and honorable senator Cn.
Tudicus. Of you, P. Volumnius, Ι speak in the same
expectation but with greater reserve, inasmuch as you
are on the jury in this case. To be brief, the whole
neighborhood, I tell you, cherishes the greatest good-
will towards the defendant. Their unanimous enthu-
siasm, solicitude, and painstaking care3 my exertions
—— and Ι have pleaded this case from beginning to end
single-handed, as Ι have long been wont to d03 and
also the justice and clemency of this court, are com-
bated by one woman, the defendant's mother. And
