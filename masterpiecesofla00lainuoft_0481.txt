others rising openly and walking out bodily. And
yet, by Hercules, our fathers tell a story of how Clau-
dius Caesar one day while walkiug up and down in

the palace, happened to hear some clapping of hands, ,

and on inquiring the cause and being told that Noni-

their love of writing and reciting to be damped either

True, the authors are mostly my friends, for almost
all the literary people are also friends of mine, and
for this reason I have spent more time in Rome than

works as to get a claim on them to come and hear

ears, all the grace of the act vanishes if you ask for
his in return. Farewell.
