260 VIR GJL

“ Safe upon Tuscan waters the fleet lies. Grani: me
to grasp

Thy right hand, sweet father, withdraw thee not from
its elasp.'' ἰω

So he replied3 and a river of tears flowed over his

Thrice ἒὲξῖῐ.) his arms he essayed ‘che beloved one’s
neck to embrace3

Thriee elasped vainly, the phantom eluded his hands
‘ ’τὼ

Thin as1 1:⁵13?ss breezes, and like some dream of the
night.

There Aeneas beholds in a valley withdrawn from the

rest πο

F ar-off glades, and a forest of boughs that sing in the
breeze3

Near them the Lethe ¹ river that glides by abodes of
the blest.

Round it numberless races and peoples floating he
sees.

So on the flowery meadows in calm, clear summer,

¹ the bees

settle on bright-hued blossoms, or stream in eom-
panies round 715

Fair white lilies, till every plain seems ringing with
sound.

Strange to the scene Aeneas, with terror suddenly
ale
Asks ofp its'meaning, and what be the streams in the
distant vale,

¹ The river of forgetfulness.
