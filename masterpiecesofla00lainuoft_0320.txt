292 HORA GE

Nor brib’d with hopes, nor dar'd with awe,
To servile salutations runs 3

But either to the olasping vine
Does the supporting poplar wed‚

Or with his pruning-hook disjoin
Unbearing branohes from their head,
And grafts more happy in their stead:

Or, elimbing to a hilly steep,

He views his herds in vales afar,

Or shears his overburden'd sheep,

Or mead for oooling drink prepares,

Of virgin honey in the jars,

Or, in the now deelining year,

WVhen bounteous Autumn rears his head,

He joys to pull the ripen’d pear‚

And clust’ring grapes with purple spread.

The fairest of his fruit he serves,
Priapus,1 thy rewards ε
Sylvauus too his part deserves,
Whose care the fences guards.
Sometimes beneath an ancient oak,
Or on the matted grass, he lies:
No god of Sleep he need invoke3
The stream, that o'er the pebbles flies,
With gentle slumber orowns his eyes.
The wind, that whistles through the sprays,
Maintains the consort of the song3
And hidden birds, with native lays,
The golden sleep prolong.
But when the blast of winter blows,
And hoary frost inverts the year,
Into the naked woods he goes,
And seeks the tusky boar to rear,

¹ A god of the fruitfulness of fields and of cattle.
