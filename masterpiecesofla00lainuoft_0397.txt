THE MARCH ACROSS THE ALPS 369

the others, and composed of rock so upright that a
light-armed soldier, making the trial, could with dif-
ficulty by laying hold of bushes and roots, which ap-
peared here and there, accomplish the descent. In
this place the precipice, originally great, had by a
late falling away of the earth been increased to the
depth of at least one thousand feet. Here the cavalry
stopped, as if at the end of their J'ourney, and Hanni-
bal, wondering what could be the cause of the troops'
halting, was told that the cliff was impassable. Then
going up himself to view the place, it seemed clear to
him that he must lead his army in a circuit, though
ever so great, and through tracks never trodden be-
fore. That way, however, was found to be impracti-
cable. The old snow indeed had become hard, and
being covered with the new of a moderate depth, the
men found good footing as they walked through it3
but when that was dissolved by the treading of so many
men and beasts, they then trod on the naked ice be-
low. Here they were much impeded, because the foot
could take no hold on the smooth ice, and was besides
more apt to slip on account of the declivity of the
ground3 and whenever they attempted to rise, either
by aid of the hands or knees, they fell again. Add to
this that there were neither stumps nor roots within
reach, on which they could lean for support 3 so that
they wallowed in the melted snow on one entire sur-
face of slippery ice. This the cattle sometimes pene-
trated as soon as their feet reached the lower bed3
and sometimes, when they lost their footing, by strik-
ing more strongly with their hoofs in striving to keep
themselves up, they broke it entirely through3 so that
the greatest part of them, as if caught in traps, stuck
fast in the hard, deep ice.
