PHAETHON 339

Dispensing equal warmth to Earth and Heaven.

Nor be thy course too low depressed, nor urged 150

Too high alost, lest Heaven or Earth in flames

Be wrapped, but safe the midway course pursue.

Nor toward the Serpent on thy right, nor near

The Altar on thy left, thy wheel incline:

At equal distance pass them. What remains 155

I trust to Fortune : -— may she aid, and more

Consult thy weal than thou dost! While Ι speak

The night hath touched the borders of the west,

And darkness flies Aurora’s face3 nor more

May I delay 3 —the World demands me 1 Grasp 160

The reins, or —— if thy breast may still be moved —

My counsel take, and not my car, while yet

Thou mayst, and from this steadfast seat —more safe

Than that thy ignorance covets — see thy Sire

Fulfil his proper task, and light the Worldt ’' 165

But the hot boy already in the car

Sate mounted, joyous in his grasp to feel

The trusted 101113, and to his Sire profuse

Poured his unwelcome thanks. The steeds, mean-
while —

Eous, Pyroeis‚ Aethon, and the fourth 170

Phlegon — with fiery neighings fill the air,

And plunge, impatient of restraint. And now

Tethys, unprescient of her grandson’s (loom,

Unbars her gates, and gives them way: the world

Immense is theirs to traversel Forth they dash 175

And cleave th’ opposing clouds, and with fleet wings

Outstrip the blast of Eurus‚¹ like themselves

Eastern of birth. Nor failed their sense at once

The lighter load to feel, and car which lacked

Its wonted weight. And, as some bark which starts 180

1 The east wind.
