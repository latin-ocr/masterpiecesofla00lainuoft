ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF A FRIEND 281

Stil] Lalage's sweet smile, sweet voice even there

I will adore.
Sm THEODORE MAR'rm.

TO CHLOE
(Odes, 1.‚ 23.)

YOU fly me, Chloe l like a vagrant fawn,
Tracing the footprints of its parent deer

Through each sequestered path and mazy lawn,
While woods and winds excite a causeless sear.

For should the aspen quiver to the breeze, ⁵
Or the green lizards rustle in the brake,

lt bounds in vague alarm among the trees,
Its beart-pulso flutters, and its fibres quake.

Yet not as tigers do I follow you,
Or Libyan lion, to destroy your charms 3 10
Then cease to linger in a mothel-'s view,

And learn the rapture of a lover’s arms.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF A FRIEND²
(odes, 1.‚ 24.)

WHY should we stem the tears that needs must flow,
Why blush, that they should freely flow and long,

To think of that dear head in death laid low?
Do thou inspire my melanoholy song,

¹ Quintilius Varus, an intimate friend of Horace and Virgil. The
ode is addressed to the latter.
