328 OVJD

If such a town and subjects you could see,

Still would you want a wife who loved like me.
For oh! Ι burn, like fires with incense bright3
Not holy tapers flame with purer light.

Aeneas is my thoughts' perpetual theme,

Their daily longing‚ ancl their nightly dream.
Yet he ’s ungrateful and obdurate still;

Fool that I am to place my heart so ill!

Myself Ι cannot to myself restore3

Stil] Ι οοηῑιΡΙειίο, and still I love him more.
Have Pity, Cupid, on my bleeding heart,

And pieree thy brother’s ¹ with an equal dart.

I rave, nor eanst thou Venus’ offspring be,
Love’s mother could not bear a son like thee.
From hardened oak, 01· from a rook's eold. womb,
At least thou art from some fieree tigress eome3
Or on rough seaS‚ from their foundation torn,
Got by the winds, and in a tempest born ε

Like that, which now thy trembling sailors fear3
Like that, whose rage should still detain thee here.
Behold how high the foamy billows ride ἶ

The winds and waves are on the juster side.

To winter weather, and a stormy sea,

I 'll owe what rather I would owe to thee.

Death thou deserv’st from heaven’s avenging laws;
But I 'm unwilling to become the cause.

To shun my love, if thou wilt seek thy fate,

’T is a dear purchase‚ and a eostly hate.

Stay but a little, till the tempest cease,

And the loud winds are lulled into a peace.

May all thy rage, like theirs, inconstant prove!
And so it will if there be power in love.
Know’st thou not yet what dangers ships sustain ἶ)

¹ Aeneas was a son of Venus and so is called a brother of Cupid.
