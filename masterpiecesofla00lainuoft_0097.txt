The firstborn of his children she in vain
Had brought the name of father to the king. 95
In arms upborne she goes, not by a train

things, that is to say of body and of place in which
things severally go on, each of the two must exist for

is empty space which we call void, there body is not3
wherever again body maintains itself‚ there empty
void nowise exists. First bodies 1 therefore are solid
and without void. Again since there is void in things
begotten, solid matter must exist about this void, and
no thing can be proved by true reason to conceal in
its body and have within it void, unless you choose to
allow that that which holds it in is solid. Agaiu that
can be nothing but a union of matter which can keep
in the void of things. Matter therefore, which consists
of a solid body, may be everlasting‚ though all things
else are dissolved. Moreover if there were no empty
void, the universe would be solid3 unless on the other
hand there were certain bodies to fill up whatever
places they occupied, the existing universe would be
