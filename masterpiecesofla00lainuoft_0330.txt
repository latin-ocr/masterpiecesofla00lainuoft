TIBULLUS

 

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

FOUR books of Eleqz'es have come down to us under the
name of Tibullus, but of these only the first two and a part
of the fourth are the work of that poet. Delia, whose real
name is said to have been Plania, and Nemesis, whose·
identity has not been determined, are the central figures of
the first and second book respectively. Most of the poems
in the fourth book written by him relate to a love affair

He was born about 54 Β. c., probably at Pedum, a town
in Latium, where his family, which belonged to the eques-
trian order, had an estate, apparently of considerable extent.

Β. c., and it was throughout his life the poet's favorite re·
treat. In Rome he was on terms of the greatest intimacy
with Valerius Messala, who like Maecenas had surrounded
himself with a group of literary men. Yet, while Messala’s
name occurs frequently in the Eleqz'es, Tibullus' position
does not at any time seem to have been one of dependence.
Of the friendly relations which existed between him and
Horace we know from the latter's works, one of the Odes
(I. 33) and one of the Epistles (I. 4) being addressed to
him. His death, which took place in 19 Β. c., is the subject
of the ninth elegy of the third book of Ovid's Amores.

Although of somewhat limited range, and not in any way
the work of a poet of the first rank, Tibullus’ elegies have
an undeniable grace and charm of their own. Free from
