PHAETHON 343

In sportive windings numberless. Burned too
Mygdonian Melas, and Eurotas born

Of Spartan Taenarus, —— Euphrates far

By Babylon, Orontes, and the flood 285
Thermodon downward hurries: - Ganges warmed,
And Phasis, and Danubius. All thy waves,
Alpheus, boiled and bubbled, and thy banks,
Spercheius, glowed. Tagus his golden freight
Rolled melted to the sea. The swans which haunt 290
Cayster's banks, and all Maeoniam founts

Make famous with their music, in mid-stream
Sickened with heat. To the world’s utmost end

Fled Nilus, burying deep in earth his head,

N e'er since to light restored ε —— his mouth remains, —
Rivers, no ruore, —- mere valleys, dry with dust. 296
Nor other lot befell that Thracian pair,

Hebrus and Strymon : —nor the western floods

Of Padus, Rhenus, Rhodanus ; nor thine,

Old Tiber, by the Fates in after years ³00
Ordained to bear the Masters of the world.

Earth's surface yawns throughout, and piercing light
Illumes all Tartarus, and shakes with fear

Hell’s Monarch and his Consort. Ocean shrinks,
And leaves a waste of sand what late was sea 3 305
And rocks jut out, late covered by the waves,

Like islands to the scattered Cyclades

New added. Fishes to the bottom dive,

Nor dare the dolphins more through air to try

Brief flight, and seals uncouth expiring float 310
Supine upon the deep. In lowest cave

Old Nereus, and his Doris, and their train

Of daughters, trembling hide. Thrice Neptune rears
His angry brow above the wave, and thrice
Withdraws, by heat o’ermastered. At the last ³15
