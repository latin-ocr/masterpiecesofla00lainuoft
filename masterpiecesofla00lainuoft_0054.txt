Geta. Yes. [Emit into DEMIPHO’S house.

Demipho. You see how the matter stands. What
am Ι to do‘? Speak‚ Hegio.

Heqz'o. What, I? With your permission, I think
that Cratinus had better speak.

Demipho. Speak‚ Cratinus.

Cratinus. What, do you want me to speak?

Demipho. Yes, you.

Cratinus. Ι should like to see you do what is to
your advantage. This is how I look at it: it’s right
and just that what your son has done in your absence
should be undone3 and you 'll be able to manage it.
That ’s what I say.

Demipho. Now do you speak‚ Hegio.

Heqio. I think that Cratinus has spoken to the
best of his ability ; but the fact is, ‘⁶ Many men, many
minds! ’' Every one has his own way. It seems to
me that what has been done by the law can’t be un-
done, and that it ’s wrong to try.

Demipho. Now, Crito.

Crito. Ι reserve my decision 3 the matter is an
important one.

Heyz'o. Can we be of any further service?

Demipho. You have done well. (Emeum advisers.)
I’m much more uncertain now than Ι was before.

Geta (enterinyfiom DEMIPHO'S house). They say
that he has n’t come back.

Demipho. Ι must wait til] my brother comes ; Ι 'll
do whatever he advises me. Ι 'll go down to the har-
bor and inquire when he is to return. [Emit.

Geta. But I’ll look for Antipho, aud let him know
what ’s been done here. Ah, there I see him coming
back in the very nick of time ἕ
