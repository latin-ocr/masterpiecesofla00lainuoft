304 TIBULLUS

Let me, a simple swain, with honest pride,
If chance a lambkin from its dam should roam,

Or sportful kid, the little wanderer chide,
And in my bosom bear exulting home. 20

Here Pales ¹ I bedew with milky showers,
Lustrations yearly for my shepherd pay,

Revere 2 each antique stone bedeck'd with flowers
That bounds the field, or points the doubtful way.

My grateful fruits, the earliest of the year, 25
Before the rural god3 shall duly wait.

From Ceres’ gifts I ’ll cull each browner ear,
And hang a wheaten wreath before her gate.

The ruddy god 4 shall save my fruit from stealth,
And far away each little plunderer scare 3 ³0

And you, the guardians once of ampler wealth,
My household gods, shall still my off’rings share.

My numerous herds that wanton'd o'er the mead
The choicest fatling then could richly yield 3

Now scarce I spare a little lamb to bleed ³5
A mighty victim for my scanty field.

And yet a lamb shall bleed, while, ranged. around,
The village youths shall stand in order meet,

With rustic hymns, ye gods, your praise resound‚
And future crops and future wines entreat. 40

¹ The tutelary deity of shepherds and cattle.

² In honor of Terminus. the god of boundaries.

³ Silvanus, who presided over woods and fields.

⁴¹ &tames of Priapus, colored red, were frequently placed in gar-

dens.
