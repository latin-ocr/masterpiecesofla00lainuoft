394 MARTIAL

weaknesses of his sellom, and was merciless in attacking
the hypocrisies and foibles of the age. His was not, in-
deed, the standpoint of outraged morality, for many of his
poems are marked by gross adulation and still grosser
obscenity3 but without making any pretences himself, he
regarded the different types of character he saw around
him as fair marks for his satire: Selius, who patrols the
whole town in the hope of meeting some one who will invite
him to dinner (IL, 14); Tongilius, who pretends to be
ill in order to obtain presents of wine and food (IL, 4Ο);
Diaulus, who hit upon the lucrative combination of being at
once physician and undertaker (L, 47) 3 Symmachus, who,
going out with a retinue of medical students to visit a
patient, found him without a sever but left him with one
(V., 9). These are a few examples chosen at random from
a long list.

The greater part of Martial’s work was done during the
reign of Domitian, who showed him some signs of favor.
After the death of the tyrant he seems to have found the
atmosphere at Rome less congenial‚ and a few years later,

early in Trajan’s reign, he retired to Bilbilis, where he
died about 104 A. D. -

A FRIEND
(Epignmi, 1.‚ 39.)

IS there a man whose friendship rare

With antique friendship may compare,

In learning steeped, both old and new,

Yet unpedantie‚ simple, true3

Whose soul, ingenuous and upright,

Ne'er formed a wish that shunned the light,
VVhose sense is sound? If such there be,
My Decianus, thou art he.
