442 JUVENAL

And when our pursc supplies the charge no more,
Borrow, unblushhxg, from our neighbor's store z

Such is the reigning vice 3 and so we flaunt,

Proud in disti-ess, and prodigal in want l 250
Briefly, my friend, here all are slaves to gold,

And words and smiles and everything is sold.

What will you give for Cossus’ 1 nod? How high
The silent notice of Veiento 1 buy?

One favorite youth is shaved‚ another shorn3 255
And while to Jove the precious spoil is borne,
Clients are taxed for offerings‚ and (yet more
To gall their patience) from their little store
Constrained to swell the minion’s ample hoard,

And bribe the page for leave to bribe his lord. 260

Who fears the crash 2 of houses in retreat
At simple Gabii, bleak Praeneste's seat,

Volsinium’s eraggy heights‚ embowered in wood,

Or Tibur, beetling o’er prone Anio's flood‘?

While half the city here by shores 3 is stayed, 265
And feeble cramps‚ that lend a treacherous aid3

For thus the stewards patch the riven wall,

Thus prop the mansion, tottering to its fall3

Then bid the tenant court secure repose‚

While the pile nods to every blast that blows. 270

O! may I live where no such fears molest,

No miclnight fires burst on my hour of rest!

For here 't is terror all ; mid the loud cry

Of “ water! water! ” the scared neighbors fly,

With all their haste can seize —the flames aspire‚ 275
And the third floor is wrapt in smoke and fire,
While you, umonscious, doze. Up‚ ho! and know,

ἶ Put for any rich patron.

² The large tenement houses, in which the majority of the people
in Rome lived, not infrequeutly collapscd.

³ Props.
