battle, and endeavored to provoke them by skirmishes
of the N umidians. On this the Roman camp was
again thrown into disturbance by mutinous behavior
on the part of the soldiers‚ and dissension between the
consuls; Paulus represented to Varro the fatal rash-
ness of Sempronius and Flaminius 3 and Varro to him
the example of Fabius as a speeious precedent for timid
and inactive commanders: the one ¹ calling gods and
men to witness that none of the blame was to be im-
puted to him of Hannibal's now holding Italy as if by
prescriptive right of possessi0n3 for he was chained
down by his colleague‚ while the soldiers‚ full of rage
and ardor for the sight, were kept unarmed. To which
the other replied that, if any missortune should happen
to the legions from their being hurried into an incon-
siderate and rash engagement, he himself, although
entirely free from all reproach‚ must yet bear a share
of the consequences, be they what they might. Let
him take care that those whose tongues were now so
ready and impetuous showed the same alertness during
the fight. ’

they thus wasted time in astercation, Hannibal, who
had kept his forces drawn up in order of battle during
a great part of the day, led back the rest towards the
camp, and despatched the Numidian horse to the other
side of the river to attack a watering party, which had
come from the smaller camp of the Romans. They
had scarcely reached the opposite bank when, merely
by their shout and the rapidity of their motions, they
dispersed this disorderly crowd 3 and then pushed for-
ward against an advanced guard stationed before the
