254 VI RGI L

“ Why of Pirithous tell, and Ixion, Lapithae 1 tall,

O'er whose brows is suspended a dark crag, ready to
fall,

Ever in act to descend? Proud couches raised upon
bright

Golden feet are shining‚ a festa] table in sight

Laden with royal splendor. The Furies’ Queen2 on
her throne 610

Sits at the banquet by — forbids them to taste it —
has flown

Now to prevent them with torch uplisted, and thun-
dering tone.

“All who have hated a brother in lifetime, all who

have laid

Violent hands on a parent, the faith of a client be-
trayed3

Those who finding a treasure have o’er it brooded
alone, 615

Setting aside no portion for kinsmen‚ a numerous
band 3

Those in adultery slain‚ all those who have raised in
the land

Treason's banner‚ or broken their oath to a master's
hand,

Prisoned within are awaiting an awful doom of their
own.

“Ask me not, what their doom, — what form of re-
quital or ill 620

Whelms them below, Some roll huge stones to the
crest of the hill,

¹ A mythical people of Thessaly, ruled by Pirithous, son of Ixion.
² Either Alecto or Megaera.
