Antipho. Well done, Phormio!

G eta. And I, too, did what Ι could.

Antipho. My Geta, Ι love you all.

Geta, The affair has begun as I 've told you. So
far everything 's quiet, and your father 's going to wait
for your uncle’s arrival.

Antipho. Why is he waiting for him ?

Geta. He said that he wished to follow his advice
in the matter.

Antipho. O Geta, how greatly Ι fear my uncle's
return, for he, as it seems, is to decide whether Ι am
to live or die.

Geta. Here 's Phaedria.
Antipho. VVhere?
Geta. There, coming out of his training-school.1

Dorio. Let me alone.

Phaedria. Do listen to what Ι have to say.

Dorio. But I ’m tired of listening to the same thing
a thousand times over.

Phaedria. But this time Ι ’ll tell you something
that you ’ll be pleased to listen to.

Dorio. Go on, I 'm listening.

Phaedria. Can’t Ι prevail on you to wait for the
next three days ἶ) ἮἿιθΓθ are you going now?

Dorio. I was wondering whether you 'd tell me
anything new.
