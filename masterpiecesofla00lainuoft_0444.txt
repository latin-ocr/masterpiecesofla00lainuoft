my feHow-soldiers perform the last funeral office, and
bury in one grave two wretched victims, who knew no
crime but that of serving the common interest of the

general’s domestic train, while numbers dispersed
themselves on every side in quest of the body3 and

be found, that the slaves of Blaesus averred under
the torture that no murder had been committed,
