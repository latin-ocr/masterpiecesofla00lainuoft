came from his own experience on his Mantuan estate. A
striking feature of the poem is the artistic interweaving of
episodes having in themselves little or nothing to do with
the main theme. The first book, for example, has a fine
description of the portents that appeared just after Caesar's
assassination3 the second, the famous passage in which the
praises of Italy are sung; the fourth, the story of Ari-
staeus. But this is only one of the devices adopted to
lighten a theme that in less skilful hands could hardly have
failed to become tedious. We have besides many finely
elaborated pictures of nature, picturesque descriptions of
rural occupations and activities, little touches of realism,
wise saws and homely maxims,-—all wrought into a per-
fect whole by the sure hand of the artist.

In the Aeneid Virgil enters the epic field. It is the
story of the coming of Aeneas of Troy and his followers to
Italy, and the founding of the Roman state. In the first
six books we are told of the sack of Troy by the Greeks,
the flight of Aeneas with a remnant of the Trojans, their
long wanderings, their visit to Sicily, their stay at Car-
thage, and Aeneas’ descent into Hades. The second half of
the poem describes the wars with the natives, ending with
the death of Turnus, the young chieftain of the Rutulians,
at the hands of Aeneas.

While we must admit the justice of some of the criticisms
of the Aeneid, —that the poet has in many passages imi-
tated and even 'plagiarized from Homer, that there ls, espe-
ciaIIy' 111 the last six books, a lack of that variety of incident
which ls so characteristic of the Homeric epics, — the poem
shows, nevertheless, qualities which give it one of the first
places in the list of the world’s great epics: descriptive
powers of a high order, a wealth of imagery that mani-
fests‘ itself sometimes in similes and metaphors, sometimes
in a single word or phrase charged with poetic associations‚
a rare skill in handling dramatic situations, a perfect mas-
tery of language‚ and lastly a marvellous command of the
dactylic hexameter.
