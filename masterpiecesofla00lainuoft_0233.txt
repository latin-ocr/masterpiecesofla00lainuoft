DAMON AND ALPHESIBOEUS 205

Now let the wolf turn tail to the sheep ; oaks stubborn
have power

Apples golden to bear, on the alder the daffodil
flower!

Droppings of amber rich from the bark of the tama-
risk rain3

Screech-owls vie with the swan, and to Orpheus
Tityrus ¹ change 3

Orpheus play for the woods, as Arion 2 with dolphins
range. 60

Begin, my flute of the mountains, with me my Mae-
nalus strain.

Nay, let the sea drown all. Farewell to the woods.
I will leap

Here from this mountain erest that for ever watches
the deep3

This death-song of the dying for last sad gift let her
keep.

Cease, my flute, it is ended, the Maenalus mountain
refrain. 65

Thus sang Damon. The answer of Alphesiboeus
again,

Muses, recount! F rail mox-tals to all things cannot
attain.

(Alphesiboeus sinys.)

Feteh me the water3 with soft wreaths circle the
altar divine 3

Burn to the gods rich boughs‚ heap frankincense on
the fire3

¹ Used here for any shepherd.
2 According to the fable he was saved from drowning by a dol-

phin which he had eharmed by his music.
