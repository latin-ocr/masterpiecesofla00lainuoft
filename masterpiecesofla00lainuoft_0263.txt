AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 235

Semblanoe of form, but in substance a fluttering bodi-
less train,

Idly his weapon had slashed the advanoing shadows
in twain. 299

Here is the path to the river of Acheron, ever by mud

Clouded‚·for ever seething with wild‚ insatiate flood

Downward, and into Cocytus disgorging its endless
sands. ’

Sentinel over its waters an awful ferryman stands,

Charon, grisly and rugged ; a growth of centurias
lies

Hoary and rough on his ehin3 as a flaming furnaee
his eyes. 305

Hung in a loop from his shoulders a foul searf round
him he ties3

Now with his pole impelling the boat, now trimming

Urgingtffisszlssel-gmy bark with its burden of corpses

Aged gaggam, but a god’s old age is unwithered and
hale.

Down to the bank of the river the streaming shadows
repam 310

Mothers„ and men, and the lifeless bodies of those
who were

Generous heroes, boys that are beardless‚ maids un-

wed,

Sons borne forth in the sight of their sires to the pile
of the dead,

Many as forest leaves that in autumn’s earliest frost
Flutter and fall, 01· as birds that in bevies floek to
the coast 315
