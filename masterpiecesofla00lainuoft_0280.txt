252 VIRGIL

Proud of his idle cunning, till Death brought punish-
ment nigh.
Straightway then the Avenger Tisiphone over them

Scourgggaghistrembling sinners, her fierce lash arming
her hands ; 575
Holds in her left uplifted her serpents grim, and from
f
Summodlsrthe awful troop of her sisters gathered for
Υ
Then agvsslie last with a grating of hideous hinges un-
close

Hell‘s infernal doors. Dost see what warders are those
Crouched in the porch‘? What presence is yonder

keeping the gate‘? 580
Know that a Hydra1 beyond it, a foe still fiercer in
hate,

Lurks with a thousand ravening throats. See! Tar-
tarus great

Yawning to utter abysses, and deepening into the
night,

Twice as profound as the space of the starry Olym-
pian height.

“Here the enormous Titans‚2 the Earth's old progeny,
hurled Δ 535

Low by the lightning, are under the bottomless waters
whirled.

Here I beheld thy children, Aloeus, giants 3 of might,

Brethren bold who endeavored to pluck down heaven
from its height,

¹ A water-snake.
² Sons of Uranus and Gaea, who were conquered by Zeus and cast
into Tartarus. ³ Otus and Ephialtes.
