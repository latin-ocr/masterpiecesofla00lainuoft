130 CICERO

THE SPEECH FOR CLUENTIUSl

(The second division of the case, from section 164 to the end.)

THERE you have, gentlemen? all that his accuse-rs
have succeeded in raking together for the whole case,
after eight years' preparation, concerning the character
of A. Cluentius, against whom, on his trial, they would
fain stir up ill-feeling. How trivial are the allegations
in themselves, how groundless in fact, how short to
answer! Listen now to what concerns the oath you
have sworn, to what belongs to your court, to what the
statute of poisoning,3 in obedience to whose summons
you are here assembled, has iniposed on you as an ob-
ligation. I should like to know how brief the state-
ment of this case could have been made, and how much
that I have said was spoken in deference to my client's
wishes, but did not in any way concern your court.

It was alleged by the prosecution that A. Cluentius
made away with Vibius Capax‘* by poison. There is

1 The trial took place in 66 Β. c. The defendant. Aulus Cluentius
Habitus, was accused of having poisoned οι- caused to be poisoned (1)
Vibius Caan, (2) Balbutius, (3) Oppianicus, his step-father. The
last was the principal count of the accusation. The prosecution was
instituted by Oppianicus' son, but the real instigator of the action was
Sassia, the wife of the alleged victim, and the mother of the defendant.
Eight years before, Oppianicus, brought to trial by Cluentius on a
charge of attempting to poison him, had been convicted, and banished
from the city. He died in exile, apparently in consequence of a fall
from his horse, but according to Sassia, from poison administered by
an agent of Cluentius. In the first part of the speech Cicero tries to
remove the prejudice that existed against his client as a result of the
feeling that he had had some part in the wholesale bribery of the
jurors at the trial of Oppianicus in 74. In the second part he deals
with ‘the specific charges of poisoning.
