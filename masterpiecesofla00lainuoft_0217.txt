THE SIEGE OF ALESIA 189

Meanwhile Vercingetorix had abandoned his camp,
and withdrawn the troops who occupied it into the
town. He took every precaution to husband his scanty
resources. He ordered the whole of the grain to be
thrown into one common stock and brought to him
for safe keeping3 and 116 let it be known that dis-
obedience would be punished with death. From time
to time each man received his scanty ration. Meat
was tolerably abundant3 for the Mandubii had driven
large numbers of cattle into the stronghold.

The appeal of Vercingetorix had meanwhile been
answered. A council of chieftains met to consider
the situation. Vercingetorix, in his great need, had
asked for an universal levy: but the cooler judgment
of the council rejected his demand. So vast a mul-
titude would become unmanageable3 and it would
be impossible to find food for so many mouths. It
was resolved, therefore, to call upon each tribe for a
limited contingent. The summons was obeyed with
alacrity 3 and from north and south and east and west,
from the Scine, the Loire and the Garonne, from
the marshes of the Scheldt and the Sambre and the
mountains of the Vosges and the Cevennes, from the
Channel and the Atlantic Ocean, horse and foot came
swanning to save the hero of Gaul. But even in
this supreme moment, in one instance, tribal jealousy
prevailed over patriotism. The Bellovaci perempto-
rily refused to send a single man. They intended,
they said, to attack Caesar on their own account,
and had no intention of being dictated to by any
one. They consented, however, as a personal favor
to Commius, king of the Atrebates, who had great
influence with them, to despatch a small contingent.
Four generals were chosen3 for, except Vercingetorix
