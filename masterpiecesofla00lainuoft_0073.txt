wronged by the fellow‚ without actually throwing
away money, and giving him means of subsistence
until he can bring off some new villainy‘?

Geta. Assuredly.

Chremes. The people who get rewarded nowadays
are those who put wrong for right.

Geta. Very true.

Demipho. So we ’ve managed matters very badly
in dealing with him.

Geta. It ’ll be all right, provided you can end the
affair as you planned‚ by getting him to marry her.

Demipho. What! Is there any doubt about that?

Geta. Indeed, I 'm rather inclined to fear (know-
ing the man’s character) that he may change his mind.

Demipho. What! Change his mind?

Geta. I don’t know, I only say “ he might.’'

Demipho. I 'll do as my brother advised: I 'll bring
his wife here to talk to her. Geta, go on abead, and

tell Phanium that Nausistrata is coming.
[Emit DEMIPHO into CHREMES’ house.

Geta. We ’ve found the money for Phaedria 3 there
has n't been a word said about the lawsuit 3 we ’ve ar-
ranged that the girl shan’t leave just yet. What
next? What 's to be done now? You 're still in the
same fix, Geta3 it ’s a case of paying one with what
you 've borrowed from another. The punishment that
was close at hand has been staved off for a while, but
your score of stripes will mount up unless you look
out. Now Ι ’ll go home and explain matters to
Phanium, so that she won’t bc afraid of Phormio or

of what Nausistrata may say.
[Exit into DEMIPHo’S house.
