AT TRIMALCHIO'S DINN ER ¹

(Satirae, 41-46.)

AS his departure delivered us from his usurpation
of the talk, we tried to draw our neighbors into eon-
versation. “What is a day?'' cried Dama, after
calling for a larger glass. ‘⁶ Nothing! Before you
have time to turn round it is night. One should
therefore go straight from the bedroom to the dining-
room. And what a regular freezing we have been
having of late! I could scarcely get hot in my bath.
However‚ a hot drink is as good as a greateoat. Ι 've
had some stiff ones, and I am about full3 it has got
into my head.’‘ Here Seleucus broke in with, “I
don’t take a bath every day. Constant washing wears
out the body as well as the olothes3 but when I've
put down my good posset of mead, Ι 0311 1011 1110 001(1
go hang. However, I could not have bathed to-day
in any ease, as I had to attend a funeral. Poor Chry-
santhus, you know, a nice fellow‚ has just slipped his
wind. It was only the other day he said how d'ye
do to me. Ι 0311 fancy I am talking to him now.
Ah, we are only air balloons, summer flies3 this life 's
a bubble. And it ’s not as if he had 11’t tried the
fasting cure. For five days neither bit nor sup
passed his lips, and yet he ’s gone. Too many doe-
tors did for him, 01· else it was to be. A doetor’s
really no use except to feel you did the right thing.
