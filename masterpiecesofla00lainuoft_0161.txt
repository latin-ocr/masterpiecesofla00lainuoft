THE SPEECH FOR CLUENTIUS 133

these past years, whatever anxiety and trouble 110 has
had at this time, has been entirely due to the machina-
tions of his mother. You allege that Oppianicus ¹ lost
his life by poison given him in a piece of bread by one
M. Asellius, an intimate friend of his, who acted, you
say, at the instigation of Habitus. Now I have first
to ask what motive Habitus had for wishing to take
the life of Oppianicus? I admit, indeed, that they
had been at enmity. But it is either from feelings of
sear or of hatred that men desire the death of their
enemies3 and what fear, I ask, could have prompted
Habitus to seek to perpetrate such a monstrous crime ?
Wassthere any reason why any one should be afraid
of Oppianicus now that he had been punished for his
crimes and banished the country? that had he to
sear? The attack of a ruined man? Impeachment
by a selon? Harm from the evidence of an outlaw?
If again it was because he hated his enemy that Habi-
tus desired his death, was he such a 1001 as to think
that the life which Oppianicus was then living — con-
demned, an outlaw, forsaken by all — was worthy of
the name, when, owing to the monstrosity of his char-
acter, no one would receive him into his house, no one
would go near him, no one would speak to him, no one
would look at him? And was it to this man that
Habitus grudged his life? If he hated him bitterly
and with all his beart, ought he not to have wished him
to live as long as possible? lVas his enemy to hasten
his death —death that in his troubles was for him the
only refuge from missortune? Why, badhe possessed
a spark of spirit or courage, he would have died by
his own hand, as many brave 111011 111 like afflictions

alleged poisoning of his stepfuther, Oppianicus.
