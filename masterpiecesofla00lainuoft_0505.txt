CUPID AND PSYC'HE 477

hostelry of a god. Golden pillars sustained the roof,
arched most curiously in cedar-wood and ivory. The
walls were hidden under wrought silver,—-all tame
and woodland creatures leaping forward to the visi-
tor’s gaze. Wonderful indeed was the craftsman, di-
vine or half-divine, who by the subtlety of his art had
breathed so wild a soul into the silveri The very
pavement was distinct with pictures in goodly stones.
In the glow of its precious metal the house is its own
daylight, having no need of the sun. W ell might it
seem a place fashioned for the conversation of gods
with men 1

Psyche, drawn forward by the delight of it, came
near, and, her courage growing, stood within the door-
way. One by one, she admired the beautiful things
she saw3 and, most wonderful of all! no lock, no
chain, nor living guardian protected that great trea-
sure-house. But as she gazed there came a voice,— a
voice, as it were, unclothed of bodily vesture. “ Mis-
tress!'’ it said, “all these things are thine. Lie
down, and relieve thy weariness, and rise again for
the bath when thou wilt. We thy servants, whose
voice thou hearest, will be beforehand with our ser-
vice, and a royal feast shall be ready.”

And Psyche understood that some divine care was
providing, and, refreshed with sleep and the bath, sat
down to the feast. Still she saw no one: only she
heard words falling here and there, and had voices
alone to serve her. And the feast being ended, one
entered the chamber and sang to her unseen‚ while
another struck the chords of a harp, invisible with him
who played on it. Afterwards the sound of a com-
pany singing together came to her, but still so that
none was present to sight, yet it appeared that a great
multitude of singers was there.
