446 ,IUVENAL

Its cumbi-ous load, tremendous 1 o'er our heads,
Projecting elm or pine, that nods on high,
And threatens death to every passer-by. 365
Heavens 1 should the axle crack, which bears a weight
Of huge Ligurian stone,1 and pour the freight
On the pale crowd beneath, what would remain,
What joint, what bone, what atom of the slain‘?
The body, with the soul, would vanish quite, πο
Invisible as air, to mortal sight!
Meanwhile, unconscious of their feHow’s fate,
At home they heat the water, 300111 the plate,
Arrange the strigils, fill the cruse with oil,
And ply their several tasks with fruitless toil3 ³75
For he who bore the dole, poor mangled ghost,
Sits pale and trembling on the Stygian coast,
Scared at the horrors of the novel 300110,
At Charon’s threateniug voice and scowling mien ;
Nor hopes a passage, thus abruptly hurled, 380
Without his farthing,2 to the nether world.

Pass we these fearful dangerS‚ and survey
What other evils threat 0111 nightly way.
And first behold the mansion's towering size,
WVhere floors on floors to the tenth 3 story rise3 385
VVhence heedless garreteers their potsherds throw,
And crush the unwary wretch that walks below 1
Clattering, the storm descends from heights unknown,
Ploughs up the street, and wounds the flinty stone!
’T is madness, dire improvidence of ill, 390
To sup abroad, before you sign your will3
Since fate in ambush lies, and marks his prey,
From every wakeful window in the way:

¹ Carrara marble. 2 Charon's see.
8 The translator exaggerates. Augustus limited the height of
buildings in Rome to seventy feet.
