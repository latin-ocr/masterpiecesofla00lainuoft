212 VIR αα

AFTER CAESAR’S DEATH
ffieorgics, 1.‚ 466—514.)

HE ¹ too it πλε, when Caesar's light was quenched‚
For Rome had pity, when his bright head he veiled
In iron-hued darkness, till a godless age

Trembled for night etei-nal 3 at that time

Howbeit earth also, and the ocean-plains‚ 5
And dogs obscene, and birds of evil bode

Gave tokens. Yea, how often have we seen

Etna, her furnace-walls asunder riven‚

In billowy floods boil o'er the Cyclops' fields,2

And roll down globes of fire and molten rocks! ιο
Α clash of arms through all the heaven was heard

⁴ By Germany3 strange heavings ,shook the Alps.

Yea, and by many through the breathless groves

A voice was heard with power, and wondrous-pale
Phantoms were seen upon the dusk of night, 15
And cattle spake, portentous 1 streams stand still,
And the earth yawns asunder, ivory weeps

For sorrow in the shrines, and bronzes sweat.
Up-twirling forests with his eddying tide,

Madly he bears them down, that lord of floods, 20
Eridanus‚3 till through all the plain are swept

Beasts and their stans together. At that time

In gloomy entrails ceased not to appear
Dark-threatening fibres, springs to trickle blood,

And high-built cities night-long to resound 25
With the wolves' howling. N ever more than then
From skies all cloudless fell the thunderbolts,

1 The sun. An eclipse took place in November of the year of the
assassination, and there were rumors of many portents.

2 Sicily, the fabled home of the Cyclops.

²³ The river Po.
