222 VIRGIL

This great God who inspires her ——the more with bit
doth he school

F iery mouth and rebellious bosom and mould her to
Wide olnuhesudden the hundred enormous mouths of

h rl ir

Fly‚ of theniaselves unclosing‚ and answer floats on ΗΞ
a1r :

“ Thou who hast ended at last with the dangers dread
of the sea,

Greater on land still wait thee. Lavinium's ¹ kingdom
afar

Teucria's children shall find — of that ancient terror
be free —

Yet shall repent to have found it. I see grim visions
of war, 90

Tiber foaming with blood. Once more shall a Simois 2
flow,

Xanthus be there once more, and the tents of a
Dorian 3 foe.

Yonder in Latium rises a second Achilles,4 and
born,

Even as the first, of a goddess3 and neither at night
nor at morn

Ever shall J uno leave thee, the Trojans' enemy
sworn, 9⁵

While thou pleadest for succor, besieging in misery
sore

Each far people and city around Ausonia’s5 shore 1

1 The city founded by Aeneas in Latium.
2 The Simois and Xanthus were the two rivers which flowed

through the Trojan plain.
³ Greek.

⁴¹ Turnus, chief of the Rutuli.
5 Italy.
