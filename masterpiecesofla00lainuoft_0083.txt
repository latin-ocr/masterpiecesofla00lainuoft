PH ORMI O 55

Phormio. What! the money I paid out at once to
my creditors?

Demipho. What ’s to be done, then?

Phormio. If you like* to give me the girl whom
you ’ve promised me, I ’ll marry her3 but if you
ehoose that she should stay with you, her dowry must
stay with me 3 for it ’s not right that Ι should be disap-
pointed to suit your convenience, seeing that, on your
account, I jilted the other girl, who was bringing me
a dowry of the same amount.

Demipho. To perdition with you, you swaggering
scoundrel! Do you think that we know so little of
you and your doings as that?

Phormio. Ι 'm getting angry.

Demipho. As if you would marry her if she were
offered to you!

Phormio. Try me!

Demipho. Your plan was that my son should keep
his wife in your house.

Phormio. Pray‚ what are you talking about?

Demipho. Just you give me my money.

Phormio. No, you give me my wife.

Demipho. Then to court with you.

Phormio. Indeed, if you trouble me any more —

Demipho. What will you do?

Phormio. I? Perhaps you think that I aot as
champion for dowerless women only? Ι do the same
for women with dowries.

Chremes. What has that to do with us?

Phormio. Oh, nothing. I knew a married woman
here in Athens whose husband —

Chremes. Eh?

Demipho. What 's that ἵ)

Phormio. Had another wife in Lemnos.

Chremes. I ’m a lost man.
