CUSTOMS OF THE GERMANS 403

fortune consists of oxen, a caparisoned horse, a shield‚
a spear‚ and a sword. She in return delivers a pre-
sent of arms, and by this exchange of gifts the mar-
riage is concluded. This is the nuptial ceremony3
this the bond of union3 these their hymeneal gods.
Lest the wife should think that her sex exempts her
from the rigor of the severest virtue and the toils of
war, she is informed of her duty by the marriage cere-
mony3 and thence she learns that she is received by
her husband to be his partner in toil and danger, to
dare with him in war, and suffer with him in peace.
The oxen yoked‚ the horse accoutred, and the arms
given on the occasion inculcate this lesson3 and
thus she is prepared to live, and thus to die. These
are the terms of their union: she receives her armor
as a sacred treasure‚ to be preserved inviolate, and
transmitted with honor to her sons, a portion for
their wives, and from them going down to her grand-
children.

In consequence of these manners the married state
is a life of affection and female constancy. The virtue
of the woman is guar-ded from seduction: no public
spectacles to seduce her, no banquets to inflame her
passions‚ no baits of pleasure to disarm her virtue.
The art of intriguing by clandestine letters is un-
known to both sexes. Populous as the country 13,
adultery is rarely heard of ; when detected, the pun-
ishment is instant, and inflicted by the husband. He
cuts off the hair of his guilty wife, and having assem-
bled her relations expels her naked from his house,
pursuing her with stripes through the village. To
public loss of honor no favor is shown. She may pos-
sess beauty, youth, and riches ; but a husband she can
never obtain. Vice is not treated by the Ger-mans
