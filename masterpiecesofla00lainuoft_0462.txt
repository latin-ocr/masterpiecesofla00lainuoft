434 J U VENAL

To the Subura ¹ — for, what desert land, ιο
What wild, uncultured spot, can more affright
Than fires wide blazing through the gloom of night,
Houses with ceaseless ruin thundering down,
And all the horrors of this hateful town ⁴?
WVhere poetS, while the dog-star glows, rehearse 15
To gasping multitudes their barbarous verse ἱ
Now had my friend, impatient to depart‚
Consigned his little all to one poor cart :
For this without the town he chose to wait3
But stopped a moment at the Conduit-gate.2 20
Here Numa3 erst his nightly visits paid,
And held high converse with the Egerian maid:
Now the once-hallowed fountain, grove, and fane
Are let to Jews, a wretched, wandering train‚
Whose furniture 's a basket filled with hay — 25
For every tree is forced a tax to pay ;
And while the heaven-born Niue in exile rove,
The beggar rents their consecrated grove I
Thence slowly winding down the vale, we view
The Egerian grots — ah, how unlike the true 1 30
Nymph of the Spring, more honored hadst thou been,
If, free from art, an edge of living green
Thy bubbling fount had circumscribed alone,
And marble ne'er profaned the native stone.
Umbricius here his sullen silence broke, 3⁵
And turned on Rome, indignant, as he spoke-
Since virtue droops, he cried‚ without regard,
And honest toil scarce hopes a poor reward ς
Since every morrow sees my means decay,

1 A densely populated district of Rome.

² The Porta Capena, in the southeast part of the city. Thea Mar-
cian aqueduet passed over it.

⁸ The second king of Rome, who was said to have received instruc-
tion from the nymph Egeria.
