ROME 439

A true-born Grecian 1 littered 011 the coast ¹
WVhere the Gorgonian hack2 a pinion lost.

Hence, Romans, hence ἶ 110 place for you remains
Where Diphilus, where Erimanthus reigns 3
Misereants, who, faithful to their native art, 170
Admit no rival in a patron’s heart:

For, let them fasten on his easy ear,

And drop one hint, one secret slander there,

Sucked from their country's venom, or their own,
That instant they possess the man alone, 175
While we are spurned, contempnmus, from the door,
Our long, long slavery thought upon no more.

’T is but a client lost ! — and that, we find,

Sits wondrous lightly on a patron's mind:

And (not to flatter our poor pride, my friend) 180
What merit with the great can we pretend,

Though in our duty we forestall the day,

And, darkling,3 run our humble court to pay;

When the brisk praetor long before is gone,

And hastening with stern voice his lictors on, 185
Lest his colleagues o’erpass him in the street,

And first the rich and childless matrons 4 greet,

Alba and Modia‚ who impatient wait,

And think the morning homage comes too late 1

Produce at Rome your witness 3 let him boast 190
The sanctity of Berecynthia's host,5

¹ At Tarsus, properly on the banks of the river Cydnus in Cilicia.

'² Pegasus, the winged horse, which sprang from the blood of the
Gorgon Medusa.

3 Before sunrise. It was the duty of a client to present himself
at his patron’s house early in the morning.

4 The efforts of legaey huuters to get a place in the wills of the
childless rich is a favorite theme with Roman satirists.

⁵ P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, chosen on account of his piety to re-

ceive the stone which represented the goddess Cybele (Berecyn—
thia).
