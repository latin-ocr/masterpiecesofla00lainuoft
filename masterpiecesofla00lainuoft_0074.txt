SCENE 2.
Emer Dmnpno and NAUSISTRATA from Cnnmms’ house.

Demipho. Now, Nausistrata, with your wonted tact,
get her into a good humor with us, so that she 'll do
willingly what she has to do.

Nausistrata. Ι will.

Demipho. You ’re helping me by your services
nOW, just as you assisted me with your money a little
while ago.

AVausistmta. You ’re quite welcome‚ but indeed
Ι ’m less able to help you, through my husband’s
fault, than Ι ought to be.

Demipho. Why?

Nausistrata. Because he ’s careless of my father-’s
honest earnings. My father used to get two talents a
year regularly out of those estates. What a difference
there is between one man and another!

Demipho. Two talents, you say?

Nausistrata. Yes, two talents‚ and that, too, when
things were much cheaper than they are now,

Demipho. Heavensl

IVausistrata. What do you think of that?

Demipho. Oh, Ι quite agree with you.

Nausistrata. I wish I ’d been born a man, I should
have shown them ———

Demipho. Ι ’111 sure you would.

IVaasistrata. How to—

Demipho. Pray, spare yourself for your interview
with the girl, lest, being so young, she tire you out.

ZVctusistrata. I'll do as you wish3 but Ι see my
husband coming out of your house.
