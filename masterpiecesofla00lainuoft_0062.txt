ACT IV.

SCENE 1.
Enter Dmnrno and CHREMES.

Demipho. -Well, have you brought back your
daughter with you, on whose account you went to
Lemnos?

Chremes. No.

Demipho. And why not?

Chremes. When her mother saw that Ι was stay·
ing here rather a long time, and the girl’s age did n't
admit of neglect on my part, she set out, so they said,
with all her household, to come to me.

Demipho. Pray, then, why did you stay there so
long after you had heard this?

Chremes. Hang it 11 Ι was ill; that delayed me.

Demipho. What caused your illness‘? The cir-
cumstances ’Β

Chremes. Do you ask me? Why, old age itself is
an illness. However, I ’ve heard, from the sailor who
brought them over, that they got here safely.

Demipho. Have you heard, Chremes, what has
happened to my son while Ι was away?

Chremes. Yes3 and his action makes me uncer-
tain what to do; for if I offer my daughter in mar-
riage to an outsider, I ’ll have to explain in detail
how and by whom she is mine. Now Ι know that I
can trust you as myself ; whereas, if an outsider
wishes to form a connection with me, he ’ll say no-
thing so long as we 're on good ternis, but if we fall
out, he ’ll know more than there 's any need of his

1 Chremes is restive under his brother's cross-questioning, and
makes somewhat evasive answcrs.
