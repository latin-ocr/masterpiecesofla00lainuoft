208 VIRGIL

Often the form of a wolf with these Ι have seen him

assume 100
And in the forests plunge, or the ghosts call forth from
the tomb,

Often remove to an alien field rich harvests of grain.
Homeward bring from the city, my ehants, bring
Daphnis again.

Cari-y the ashes without, Amaryllis, and into the brool<

Over thy shoulders fling them, nor venture behind
thee to look! 105

These are for Daphnis; he reeks nor of gods nor
magieal strain.

Homeward bring from the city, my chants‚ bring
Daphnis again.

Look! As I linger to take it, the cinder itself from

the rate

Catehes th} altar with fliekering flames. Good luek
on us wait!

Ay, there is something surely, and Hylax barks at
the gate! 110

Ought I to hope? Or do lovers their own dreams
, fashion in vain?
Cease, my chants. From the city he eomes, my
Daphnis, again.
Sm CHARLES Bownn.

RULES OF HUSBANDRY
(Georgics‚ 1., 176-203.)

MANY the precepts of the men οἱ old,
I can recount thee, so thou start not back,
And such slight cares to learn not weary thee.
