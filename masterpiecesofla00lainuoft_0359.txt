DIDO TO AENEAS 331

Oh! such he was, and is, that, were he true,
Without a blush I might his love pursue3

But eruel stars my birthday did attend⁷

And, as my fortune opened, it must end. 120
My plighted lord was at the altar slain,

Whose wealth was made my bloody brother’s gain 3
Friendless, and followed by the murderer’s hate,

To foreign countries I removed my fate 3

And here, a suppliant‚ from the natives' hands 125
I bought the ground on which my city stands,

With all the ooast that stretohes to the sea,

E'en to the friendly port that sheltered thee 3

Then raised these walls, which mount into the air,

At once my neighbors’ wonder, and their fear. 1³0
For now they arm 3 and round me leagues are made,
My searee established empire to invade.

To man my new-built walls I must prepare,

A helpless woman, and unskilled in war.

Yet thousand rivals to my love pretend, 135
And for my person would my erown defend 3

Whose jan-ing notes in one complaint agree,

That each unjustly is disdained for thee.

To proud Iarbas ¹ give me up a prey,

For that must follow, if thou goest away3 140
Or to my husband’s murderer leave my life,

That to the husband he may add the wife.

Go then, since no complaints ean move thy mind 3
Go‚ perjured man, but leave thy gods ² behind.
Toueh not those gods, by whom thou art forsworn, 145
Who will in impious hands no more be borne 3

Thy saerilegious worship they disdain‚

And rather would the Greeian fires sustain.

1 A local prince, one of Dido’s suitors.
² Aeneas had borne the images of his gods from Troy.
