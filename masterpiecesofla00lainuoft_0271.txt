AENEAS’ DESCENT INTO HADES 243

Whom‚ at a mother's bosom, and strangers to life’s
sweet breath‚

Fate's dark day took from us, and drowned in un-
timeliest death.

Near them are those who, falsely aocused, died guilt-

less, although 435
Not without trial, or verdiot given, do they enter be-
low3

Here, with his um, sits Minos1 the judge, eonvenes
from within
Silent ghosts to the ooumzil, and learns each life and

its sin.

N ear them inhabit the sorrowing souls, whose innocent
hands

Wrought on themselves their ruin, and strewed their
lives on the samis, 440

Hating the glorious sunlight. Alas 1 how willingly
they '

Now would endure keen want, hard toss, in the re·
gions of day!

Fate forbids it3 the loveless lake with its waters of
woe

Holds them, and nine times round them entwined‚
Styx bars them below.

Further faring, they see that beyond and. about them
are spread 445

Fields of the Mourners‚ for so they are called in
worlds of the dead.

Here dwell those whom Love, with his oruel siokness‚
hath slain.

Lost in secluded walks‚ amid myrtle groves overhead‚

lHMinos, king of Crete, became after his death one of the judges
in ades.
