SJGNS oF BAD WEA THER 211

With brimming dykes are flooded, and at sea

No mariner but furls his dripping sails.

Never at unawares did shower annoy: 30
Or, as it rises‚ the high-soaring eranes

- F lee to the vales before it, or, with face

Upturned to heaven, the heifer snuffs the gale
Through gaping nostrils, or about the meres
Shrill-twittering flits the swallow‚ and the frogs as
Croueh in the mud and cham: their dirge of old.

Ost, too, the ant from out her inmosfi cells,

Fretting the narrow path, her eggs eonveys ;

Or the huge bow sueks moisture 3 or a host

Of rooks from food returning in long line 40
Clamor with jostling wings. Now mayst thou see
The various ocean-fowl and those that pry

Round Asian meads1‚ within thy freshet-pools‚
Cayster, as in eager rivalry,

About their shoulders dash the plenteous spmy, 45
Now duek their head beneath the παπ, now run

Into the billows‚ for sheer idle joy

Of their mad bathing-revel. Then the erow

With full voice, good-for-naught‚ inviting rain,
Stalks on the dry sand mateless and alone. 50
Nor e’en the maids, that eard their nightly task‚
Know not the storm-sign‚ when in blazing erock
They see the lamp-cil sputtering with a growth

Of mouldy snuff-elots.
