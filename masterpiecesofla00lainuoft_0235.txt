DAMON AND ALPHESIBOEUS 207

Crumble the cake, let the boughs of the bay-tree
crackle and blaze. 85

Daphnis has fired me with passion, I light over
Daphnis the bays.

Homeward bring from the city, my ehants‚ bring
Daphnis again.

May such love upon Daphnis be laid as the heifeffs,
h.
Wearilyvlagtenelier mate through the forest and hills
in the quest. 89
Down by the river bank upon greenest sedges she lies,
Lost in her grief, nor remembers at nightfall late to
r1s .
Such niay ehis love be, nor I care ever to heal his
unrest.
Homeward bring from the city, my ohants, bring
Daphnis again.

These worn garments he left me, my faithless love, as

Pledgetslledggriltof himself;——by the door let them
buried romain. 95

Hold them, O Earth! they are pkzdges, and owe me
the Daphnis I lent.

Homeward bring from the city, my ohants, bring
Daphnis again.

These green herbs, these poisons from Pontusl
gathered in bloom‚

Moeris 2 gave me 3 in plenty they grow on the Pontus
plain3

¹ On the shores of the Black Sea.
² A shopherd and soreorer.
