326 O VI D

18 A. D. To the periodos his exile belong the Epistolae
ex Ponto, the Tristia, and other miscellaneous poenis.

While Propertius puzzles us by his curious sels-absorp-
tion, Ovid amazes us by his cleverness, his quickness, his
versatility, and his astounding facility in metrical composi-
tion. The stletamorplwses constitute one of the most re-
markable tours de force in literary history. They show,
successfully combined in one whole, a bewildering array of
myths that have as their only common theme some kind of
change of form. Fable is linked to fable, myth to myth,
with a nicety of juncture that never faiis, a variety of
device that seems to be inexhaustible. In the stories them-
selves we find all the qualities of the literary artist whose
natural gifts have been supplemented by training and prac-
tice: verve in narration, picturesqueness in description,
skill in the elaboration of simile or metaphor, and the faculty
of writing in smoothly flowing verse that knows no pause.
Swift‚ vivid, brilliant, never wearying us except by the
infinity of his surprises, coercing our admiration of his story-
teller’s art, he carries us along through his strange world of
ever changing forms that begin with Deucalion and end
with Julius Caesar. In the Fasti, with their explanations
of the festivals of the different months, we see the same
characterismos, but added to them something more serious,
an aetiological spirit that makes them the most substantial
of all the poet's works. His erotic elegies and his Art of
Love, written to amuse himself and ⁵others as flippant as
himself, show him to have been, in some moods at‘least,
frivolous to the last degree of frivolity, careless of himself
and of the society in which he moved, such a man as could
only have been produced by an age iu which the old repub-
lican virtue and simplicity had given way to luxury and
even immorality.
