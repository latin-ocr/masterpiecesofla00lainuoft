210 VIRGIL

SIGNS OF BAD WEATHER
(Georgics‚ 1., 351-392.)

AY, and that these things we might win to know

By certain tokens, heats and showers‚ and winds

That bring the frost, the Sire of all himself

Ordained what warnings in her monthly round

The moon should give, what bodes the south wind’s
fall; ⁵

What oft-repeated sights the herdsman seeing

Should keep his cattle closer to their stalls.

No sooner are the winds at point to rise,

Thau either Ocean's firths begin to toss

And swell, and a dry oraekling sound is heard 10

Upon the heights, or one loud ferment booms

The beach afar, and through the forest goes

A murmur multitudinous. By this

Soaroe can the billow spare the curved keels,

When swift the sea-gulls from the middle main 15

Come winging, and their shrieks are shoreward borne,

When ocean-loving cormorants on dry land

Besport them, and the hern, her marshy haunts

Forsaking‚ mounts above the soal-ing cloud.

Oft, too, when wind is toward, the stars thou ’lt see 20

From heaven shoot headlong‚ and through murky
night

Long trails of fire white-glistening in their wake,

Or light chaff flit in air with fallen leaves, ,

Or feathers on the wave-top float and play.

But when from regions of the furious North 25

It lightens, 'and when thunder fills the halls

Of Eurus 1 and of Zephyr, all the fields

1 The southeast wind.
