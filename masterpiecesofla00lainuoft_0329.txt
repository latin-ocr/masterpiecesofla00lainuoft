To HIS BOOK - 301

Of vulgar hands shall your first freshness spoil, 20
You will be left to nibbling worms a prey,
Or sent as wrappers to lands far av'vay.
Then one, whose warnings 011 your ears fell dead,
With a grim smile will note how you have sped,
Like him who, driven past patience by his mule, 25
Pushed o’er a precipice the restive fool, —-
“ Oho! so you 're determined to destroy
Yourself‘? Well, do it, and I wish you joy 1 ’²
Yet one thing more awaits your failing age 3
That in suburban schools your well—thumbed page 30
Will be employed by pedagogues to teach
Young boys with painful pangs the parts of speech.
But if, perchance‚ some sunny afternoon
To hear your voice shall eager ears attune,
Say, that though born a freedman’s son, possessed 35
Of slender means, beyond the parent nest
I soared on ampler wing 3 thus what in birth
I lack‚ let that be added to my worth.
Say, that in war, and also here at home,
I stood well with the foremost men of Rome; 40
That small in stature, prematurely grey,
Sunshine was life to me and gladness 3 say
BesideS, though hasty in my temper, I
Was just as quick to put my anger by.
Then, should my age be asked you, add that four 45
And forty years I ’d flourished, and no more,
In the December of that year, which fame
Will join with Lepidus' ¹ and Lollius’ name.

Sm THEODORE MAR'rm.

1 Lepidus and Lollius were the consuls in Β. c. 21.
