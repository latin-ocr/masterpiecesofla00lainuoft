HORACE

To mc my Thracian Chloe’s rule

A joy most sweet doth give. ιο

With songs and lute she charms 3 Ι 'd die
That she might live.

LYDIA

Το me my Thurian ¹ Calais

A burning love doth give3

A mutual love, for Ι ’(1 twice die ιε
That he might live.

HORACE

What if I ope the door to thee,
And auburn Chloe spurn 3
If with a lasting yoke we 're joined,
And love return? 20

LYDLA

Though fickle thou as cork, and rough
As Hadria‚2 while he

Is fairer than a star, —— Ι ’d live,
I ’d die with thee.
