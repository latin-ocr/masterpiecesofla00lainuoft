AENEAS' DESCENT INTO HADE'S 223

So shall a bride ¹ from the stranger again thy nation
destwy,

Once more foreign espousals a great woe bring upon

’ Yield 111ξῖ (ilion to disasters‚ confront them boldly, and

Boldly [ἕξεί fortune suffers —and first from a toviii)
of the Greek?

Marvel to say3 shall be shown thee the way salvation
to seek.''

So from her awful shrine the Cumaean Sibyl intones
Fate's revelation dread, till the cavern echoes her

groans‚

Robing her truths in gloom. So shakes, as she fumes
in unrest‚ 105

Phoebus his bridle reins, while plunging the spur in
her breast.

After her madness ceased and her lips of frenzy were
still,

Thus Aeneas replied: “ No vision, lady, of ill
Comes unimagined now to the exile here at thy door3
Eaeh has he counted and traversed already in spirit
before. 110
One sole grace I entreat — since these be the gates,
Saered 11)]ῧὲἓέἶάῃᾶ the twilight lake by the Acheron 3
Leave tfgci'evisit the face of the sire 4 I have loved so
Teaeh tilhetillie way thyself‚ and unlock yon portals of hell.

1 Aeneas married Lavinia, daughter of king Latinus, who had been
previously betrothed to Turnus.

² Pallanteum, the city of Evander.

³ One of the rivers of Hades. 4 Anchises.
