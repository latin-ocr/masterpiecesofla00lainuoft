wrought her of old.

Roamed in a spacious wood. Through shadow the
chieftain soon

Dimly discerned her face, as a man, when the month
is but young,

Sees, or believes he has seen, amid cloudlets shining,
the moon.

Tears in his eyes, he addressed her with tender love
as of old:

¹ Wife of Theseus, who killed herself when her stepson Hippoly-
tus rejected her love.

2 Wife of Cephalus, who, moved by jealousy to spy upon her hus-
band, was accidentally killed by him.

3 Killed by her son Alcmaeon, because, bribed with a necklace,
she had induced her husband to join the expedition of the Seven
against Thebes, in which he was slain.

4 Wife of Minos.

⁵ Wife of Capaneus, who threw herself on her husband's funeral
pyre and perished.

ὓ Wife of Protesilaus, the first Greek who fell at Troy.

⁷ A girl whom her lover Neptune transformed into a man, but who,
on being slain by the Centrum, was retransformed.

8 She had committed suicide after Aeneas' departure from Car-
thage.
