286 H ORA ΟΕ

The wildest winds rock most the loftiest pine-trees‚

The heaviest crash is that of falling towers‚ ιο

The spots on earth most stricken by the lightning
Are its high places.

The mind well-trained to eope with either fortune,
Takes hope in adverse things and fear in prosperous;
Deforming winters are restored or banished 15

By the same Father.

If to-day frown, not therefore frowns to·morrow ;
His deadly bow not always bends Apollo,
His hand at times the silent muse awakens
With the sweet harpstring. 20

In life's sore straits brace and display thy eourage ;
Boldness is· wisdom then z as wisely timid
When thy sails swell with winds too strongly fav'ring,

Heed, and contract them.

A RECONCILIATION
(odes, 111., 9.)

HORACE

WHEN thy fair neck had never felt

Caress more dear than mine,

I happier lived than Persia's King‚
For I was thine.

LYDIA

WVhen thy hot beart had never burned 5
For Chloe, and was mine,
I lived more famed than Ilia,l

For I was thine.
