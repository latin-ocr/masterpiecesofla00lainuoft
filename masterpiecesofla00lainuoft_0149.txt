JULJA AND MANLIUS

F airly bound and firmly tied3
Come away then, happy bride,
Hastam hence away!

XXVI.

Make ready. There Ι see within
The bride is veil'd3 the guests begin
To muster close and slow:
Trooping onward close about,
Boys, be ready with a shout -—
‘⁶ Hymen I Hymen Σ Ho Ι ”

XXVI Ι.

Now begins the free career,1 —
For many a jesi] and many a J'eer‚
And many a merry saw ;
Customary taunts and gibes‚
Such as ancient use prescribeS‚
And immemorial law·

xxvm. 2

“ Some at home, it must be fear'd‚
Will be slighted‚ and cashier'd‚
Pride will have a fall 3
Now the favorites' reign is o’er,
Proud enough they were before, —
Proud and nice withal.

XXIX.

“ Full of pride and full of scorn3
Now you see them clipt and shorn,

¹ The procession was conducted with the greatest hilarity.

² Stanzas xxviii.-xxxii. seem to have been sung· by a choir of boys,
who forecast the changes in the bridegroom’s household after his

marriage.
