THE BATTLE OF CANNAE 379

from the blame of this day's disaster, take this horse
while you have any remains of strength3 I will raise
you up and protect you. Add not to the fatality
of the fight the death of a consul3 without that
there will be abundant cause of tears and mourn-
ing.'' The consul replied, “Your spirit, Cneius
Cornelius,1 I commend3 but do not waste in un-
availing commiseration the short time allowed you
for escaping out of the hands of the enemy. Go,
carry a public message from me to the Senate‚ that
they fortify the city of Rome, and before the victori-
ous Carthaginian arrives secure it with a powerful
garrison. Carry also a private message to Quintus
Fabius: tell him that Lucius Aemilius has lived, and
now dies, in careful observance of his directions.
As to myself, let me expire here, in the midst of my
slaughtered soldiers, that I may neither be brought
a second time to trial on the expiration of my con-
sulship, nor stand forth an accuser of my oolleague,
as if my own innocence were to be proved by the im-
peachment of another.’' While they were thus dis·
coursing, first a crowd of their flying countrymen, and
afterwards the enemy, came on them 3 and these, not
knowing the consul, overwhelmed him with their weap-
ons. Lentulus, during the confusion, escaped through
the swiftness of his horse. A general rout now took
place3 seven thousand men fied into the smallcr camp,
ten thousand into the greater, and about two thousand
into the village of Cannae3 bnt the town not being
defended by any fortifications, these were instantly
surrounded by Carthalo and the cavalry. The other
consul, without joining any party of his routed troops,
gained Venusia, with about sevcnty hol-semen. The
