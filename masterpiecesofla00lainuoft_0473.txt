ROME 445

VVhere brawling taverns banish all repose‘?
Sleep to the rich alone his visits pays,
And hence the seeds of many a dire disease.
The carts’ loud rumbling through the narrow way,
The drivers’ clamors at each casua] stay, 340

And, lest amid the way the flames 6 expire,

Glide nimbly on, and gliding fan the fire 3

Through the close press with sinuous efforts wind, ³60

And, piece by piece, leave his botehed rags behind.
Hark! groaning on, the unwieldy wagon spreads
