30 TERENCE
Antipho. I lucky‘?

Phaedria. You 've got your sweetheart‚ and you ’ve
never had to face a trouble like this.

Antipho. Got her! no, Ι ’m like the man in the
proverb, Ι “ hold a wolf by the ears.'’ 1

Dorio. That 's just my difficulty with this fellow.

Antipho. Oh, don’t be a slave—trader by halves!
(To PHAEDRIA.) Has he done anything final?

Phaedria. He? Yes, acted like a perfect brute,
sold my Pamphila.

Geta. What 1 Sold her?

Antipho. What 's that you say? Sold her?

Phaedria. That ’s what he ’s done.

Dorio. What a crime, for a man to sell a girl that
he bought with his own money 1

Phaedria. I can’t get him to wait for me and put
off his other purchaser for just the next three dayS‚
while Ι get together the money that I've been pro-
mised by my friends. If Ι don’t give it you then,
don't wait an hour longer.

Dorio. Stil] dinning that into my ears 1

Antipho. It 's not a long time that he asks for.
Agree to his proposition. He ’11 repay twice over the
benefit you confer.

Dorio. That ’s all talk.

Antipho. Will you let Pamphila be banished from
the city? Have you the heart to sunder their love?

Dorio. Neither you nor Ι 11εε(1 trouble about that.

Geta. May all the gods give you what you desei-vel

Dorio. Ι ’ve borne with you against my will for
several months3 you 've been all promises and tems,
but no cash3 now, instead, Ι 've found a man with
cash and no tearS. Make way for your betters.
