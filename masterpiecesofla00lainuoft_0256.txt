228 VIRGIL

Foremost the faithful ehieftain. Anon to their tasks
they hie ;
Speed, though weeping sorely, the Sibyl’s mission,

and vie,

Building the funeral altar with giant trees to the
sky. ’

Into the forest primeval‚ the beasts’ dark cover, they

Pine-treges fall with a erash and the holm-oaks ring to
the blow.

Ash-hewn timbers and fissile oaks with the wedges
are rent3

Massive ash-trees roll from the mountains down the
desceut.

F oremost strides Aeneas, as ever, guiding the way,

Cheering his men, and equipped with a forester’s axe
as they. 190

Long in his own sad thoughts he is plunged —then
raising his eyes

Over the measureless forest, uplifts his prayer to the
skies.

“ O that in this great thieket the golden braneh of
Might 11166 ἔέξὲεὼῑᾶ 1 For 111 all she related yonder of
thee 194

Ever, alas! Misenus, the prophetess spake too true.”

Lo! at the words twain doves came down through the
heavenly blue‚

And at his side on the green turf lighted. The hero

Knows 0sslffi1gglestial birds of his mother,1 and eries
with joy:
