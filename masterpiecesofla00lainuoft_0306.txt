278 H ORA ΟΕ

In the sweet laugh‚ that marks the spot
there hid the fair one lies,

The token from the wrist besought,

Or from the finger wrung, that not

Too oruelly denies. ao

TO LEUCONOE
(odes, 1.‚ 11.)

ΑΕΚ not ('t is forbidden knowledge) what our destined
term of year,

Mine and yours3 nor scan the tables of your Baby·
lonish seers.

Better far to bear the future, my Leuconoe, like the
past,

Whether Jove has many winters yet to give, or this
our last3

This, that makes the Tyrrhene billows spend their
strength against the shore3 5

Strain your wine, and prove your wisdom 3 life is
short 3 should hope be more?

In the moment of our talking, envious time has ebb'd
away. v

Seize the present: trust to-morrow e’en as little as

you may‘ J orm Conmomn.

TO THE SHIP OF STATE¹
(odes, 1.‚ 14.)

O smP of state,
Shall new winds bear you back upon the sea?

² This ode was written at a time when there seemed to be some
possibility of civil war breaking out again.
