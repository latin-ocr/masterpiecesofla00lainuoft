the disturbance had been sent to Nauportum, having
heard of the commotion in the camp, seized the col-

length of his journey. Rufus had risen from a eom-
mon soldier to the rank of centurion, and was after-
wards made prefect of the camp. In that station he
endeavored to recall the rigor of ancient discipline.
