Under his auspices Rome, our glorious Rome, shall

Earth with her empire ruling‚ her great soul touching
the skies.

Lo l seven mountains enwalling, a single city, she

Blest in her warrior brood! So crowned with towers

Ride through Phrygia’s eities the great Berecynthiam
queen,1

Proud of the gods her children, a hundred sons at her
knee,

All of them mighty immortals, and lords of a heavenly

Turn thy glanae now hither‚ behold this glorious elan,

Romans of thine. See Caesar, and each generation
of man

Yet to be born of Iulus beneath heaven's infinite
Yonderdbleliedld thy hero, the promised prince, upon
Often {lgrmllopes have dwelt, Augustus Caesar, by

birth 799

Kin to the godlike dead, who a golden age upon earth

Comes to renew where once o’ er Latium Saturn
reigned,

Holding remote Garamantes and India’s tribes en-

Far beyffdldtdnglil. our planets the land lies, far beyond

Heavenl'llglllld the sun's own orbit, where Atlas, lifting
